  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The letters contained in this volume begin with one
written just after Caesar's final victory over the
remains of the Pompeian party at Thapsus in April,
46 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and cover three of the last four years of
Cicero's life. When they open, Cicero was enjoying
a restful interval after the troublous times of the
Civil War. He had made his peace with Caesar and
reconciled himself to a life of retirement and literary
activity. In the Senate he never spoke except to
deliver a speech pleading for the return from exile
of his friend Marcellus; and his only other public
appearance was to advocate the cause of another
friend, Ligarius. In both he was successful; and,
indeed, so he seems also to have been in private
appeals to Caesar on behalf of friends. But their
relations were never intimate,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and Cicero appears
always to have felt ill at ease in Caesar's society,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
disliking and fearing him as a possible tyrant or at
least an anomaly in a Republican state. He evidently
felt, too, some natural qualms at being too much of
a turn-coat, as he dissuaded his son from joining
Caesar's expedition to Spain at the end of the year
on that ground, and persuaded him to go to Athens
to study instead.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a> No doubt he considered that
it was more consonant with the dignity which he
was always claiming for himself to take no part in
public affairs at all than to play a secondary part
where he had once been first. Consequently he spent
the year 46 peacefully engaged in writing and in his</p>

</div>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_I'>I</span>private affairs; and even of those we hear little, as
he was at Rome the greater part of the time.
Somewhat under protest he wrote, apparently at
the suggestion of the Caesarian party,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> with most
of whom he was on good terms, a work on Cato,
which satisfied neither friend nor foe, as Brutus
thought it necessary to write another himself, and
Caesar composed an <cite>Anti-Cato</cite>. Of his other writings,
two rhetorical works, the <cite>Brutus</cite> and the <cite>Orator</cite>,
and one philosophical, the <cite>Paradoxa</cite>, fall in this
year. In the early part of it he divorced Terentia,
and at the end of it married his rich and youthful
ward Publilia; but he soon separated from her. The
unhappy marriage between his daughter Tullia and
her profligate husband, Dolabella, was dissolved at
much the same time, but she only survived for a few
months. Her death, which occurred in February,
45 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, seems to have prostrated Cicero with grief,
and a long series of daily letters, from March to
August of that year, are largely filled with reiterations
of his grief and projects for the erection of a
shrine in her honour. They are interesting for the
light they cast on Atticus' treatment of Cicero when
he was unstrung and excited. Atticus evidently
disapproved entirely of the project; but from
Cicero's answers one infers that he kept on humouring
him and at the same time delaying action on his
part by continual suggestions of a fresh site for the
shrine, knowing that Cicero's ardour would cool and
the scheme drop through, as it did.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Much is said, too, in these letters about the
literary work to which Cicero turned with more
eagerness than ever to assuage his grief; and the
output was enormous. A book on consolation in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_II'>II</span>times of sorrow, a general introduction to the philosophical
works which followed, the <cite>De Finibus</cite>, the
<cite>Academica</cite>—rewritten, three times<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a>—and a small
rhetorical treatise, the <cite>Partitiones Oratoriae</cite>, were
published during the year, while the <cite>Tusculanae Disputationes</cite>,
the <cite>De Natura Deorum</cite> and the <cite>De Senectute</cite>
were projected and begun. Certainly Cicero was
right in saying that he had no lack of words!<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Of political affairs little is said; indeed, in Caesar's
absence there was not much to say. But there are
occasional sneers at the honours paid to him<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and at
his projected extension of Rome.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a> For the latter
part of the year, after Caesar's return from Spain,
there are no letters in this collection except two
amusing letters in December, one describing a conversation
with his nephew, who was trying to make
peace with his relatives after a violent quarrel,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
and the other Cicero's entertainment of Caesar at
Puteoli.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Not long afterwards came the murder of Caesar,
at which Cicero to his regret was not present, though
he was in Rome and hastened to the Capitol to lend
his support to the murderers. He found, however,
the cold Brutus hard to stir into action, and after
Antony's speech at the funeral he thought it wiser
to retire from Rome. The letters written at the
time are full of rejoicing at the death of a man,
towards whom he never seems to have felt any
attraction, in spite of the kindness he had received
at his hands. But he soon realised the hopelessness
of the Republican cause, which lacked both a leader
and a following. He himself regained something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_III'>III</span>of his old position, and we find him not only consulted
by Brutus and the rest of his party, but
politely addressed by Antony in a note, asking his
permission to recall Cicero's old enemy Clodius.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
Cicero, taking the request as a demand, returned an
equally polite note of assent;<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a> but what he thought
of the request and of Antony is shown by a letter
sent to Atticus simultaneously.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a> For a while there
are occasional bursts of hope in a revival of the old
constitution, for instance when Dolabella threw
down the column erected in the forum in honour of
Caesar;<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a> but despair at the inactivity of Brutus
and his friends and at Antony's growing influence
and the respect shown for Caesar's enactment after
his death prevail; and Cicero contemplated crossing
to Greece to visit his son and escape from the war he
foresaw. Octavian's arrival and opposition to Antony
did not comfort him much, in spite of attentions
paid to himself by the future emperor, as he mistrusted
Octavian's youth, his abilities and his intentions.
But, when just on the point of sailing,
news reached him that there was a chance of Antony
giving way and peace with something of the old
conditions being restored; and he hurried back to
Rome to take his part in its restoration.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a> There
he found little chance of peace, but, once returned,
he recovered sufficient courage to take the lead in the
Senate and deliver his first <cite>Philippic</cite> against Antony.
After that there are only a few letters written
towards the end of the year. In them he still expresses
great mistrust for Octavian, who was continually
appealing to him for his support;<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c008'><sup>[16]</sup></a> and, in
spite of his renewed entry into public affairs, one</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_IV'>IV</span>is rather surprised to find that he was still working
at his philosophical treatises, writing the <cite>De Officiis</cite>
to dedicate to his son,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c008'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and even eager to turn to
history at the suggestion of Atticus.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c008'><sup>[18]</sup></a> Such is the
last glimpse we get of him in the <cite>Letters to Atticus</cite>.
Shortly afterwards he returned to Rome, and for
some six months led the senatorial party in its
opposition to Antony; but, when Octavian too
turned against the party and the struggle became
hopeless, he retired to Tusculum, where he lived
until he was proscribed by the Triumvirs early in
December. Then he contemplated flight to Greece,
but was killed at Astura before he had succeeded
in leaving Italy.</p>

<p class='c000'>I must again acknowledge my indebtedness in
preparing the translation to Tyrrell's edition of the
Letters and to Shuckburgh's translation, from both
of which I have "conveyed" many a phrase. The
text is as usual based on the Teubner edition, and
textual notes have been mainly confined to passages
where a reading not found in that edition was
adopted. In those notes the following abbreviations
are used:—</p>

<p class='c009'><em>M</em> = the <cite>Codex Mediceus</cite> 49, 18, written in the year
1389 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, and now preserved in the Laurentian
Library at Florence. <em>M<sup>1</sup></em> denotes the reading of
the first hand, and <em>M<sup>2</sup></em> that of a reviser.</p>

<p class='c009'>Δ = the reading of <em>M</em> when supported by that of
the <cite>Codex Urbinas</cite> 322, a MS. of the fifteenth
century, preserved in the Vatican Library.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>O</em> = <cite>Codex</cite> 1, 5, 34 in the University Library at Turin,
written in the fifteenth century. <em>O<sup>1</sup></em> denotes the
reading of the first hand, and <em>O<sup>2</sup></em> that of a reviser.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_V'>V</span><em>C</em> = the marginal readings in Cratander's edition of
1528, drawn from a MS. which is lost.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Z</em> = the readings of the lost <cite>Codex Tornaesianus</cite>.
<em>Z</em><sup>b</sup>, <em>Z</em><sup>l</sup>, <em>Z</em><sup>t</sup>, the readings of the same MS. when
attested only by Bosius, Lambinus, or Turnebus
respectively.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>L</em> (marg.) = readings in the margin of Lambinus'
second edition.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the eleventh day after parting from you I
have scribbled these few lines while leaving my
country house before daybreak. I am thinking of
stopping to-day at my place at Anagnia, to-morrow
at Tusculum and staying there one day. On the
26th then to our tryst; and I only wish I could
run straight to the embraces of my Tullia and the
lips of Attica. What those little lips are prattling,
please write and let me know, while I am at Tusculum,
or, if she is in the country, what she is writing
to you: and in the meantime pay my respects by
letter or in person to her, and to Pilia too. And
all the same, though we are to meet at once, write
to me, if you have anything to say.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I was folding up this letter, a messenger came
in the night to me with a letter of yours, and on
reading it I was naturally very sorry to hear of
Attica's slight attack of fever. Everything else I
was wanting to hear, I learn from your letter. You
say it is a sign of old age to want a bit of fire in the
morning: it's a worse sign of old age to be a bit
weak in your memory. I had arranged for the 27th
with Axius, the 28th with you, and the 26th, the
day I arrive, with Quintus. So please count on</p>

<p class='c000'>You are the only person I know less given to
flattery than myself, and, if we both fall into it
sometimes in the case of other people, certainly we
never use it to one another. So listen to what I
am saying with all sincerity. On my life, Atticus,
I don't count even the Isles of the Blest, let alone
my place at Tusculum—though in other respects
I'm comfortable enough there—worth so long a
separation from you. So let us harden our hearts
for these three days—assuming that you are affected
as I am, which I am sure is the case. But I should
like to know whether you are starting to-day<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c008'><sup>[26]</sup></a> immediately
after the auction, and on what day you are
coming. In the meantime I am buried in my books,
and annoyed that I have not got Vennonius' history.
But, not to neglect business altogether, for that debt
that Caesar assigned to me<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c008'><sup>[27]</sup></a> there are three means I
might use. I could buy the property at a public
auction; but I would rather lose it—it comes to the
same thing in the end, besides the disgrace. I
might transfer my rights for a bond payable a year
hence by the buyer: but whom can I trust, and
when would that "year of Meton"<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c008'><sup>[28]</sup></a> come? Or I</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r26'>26</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or, as Tyrrell and Shuckburgh, "whether you are
coming to-day or, if not, on what day you are coming." But

you suggest.</p>

<p class='c000'>But about Cato, that would puzzle a Philadelphian
lawyer. I cannot manage to write anything that
your boon companions could read, I won't say with
pleasure, but even without annoyance. If I steer
clear of his utterances in the House and of his
entire political outlook and policy, and content
myself with simply eulogizing his unwavering constancy,
even that would be no pleasant hearing
for them. But he is a man who cannot properly be
eulogized, unless these points are fully treated, that
he foresaw the present state of affairs, and tried to
prevent it, and that he took his own life by preference
to seeing it come about. Can I win Aledius'
approval of any of that? But pray be careful
of yourself and devote the common sense you devote
to other things, before all to recovering your
health.</p>

you think it convenient, I should like you to ask
him about that. But why put it off? I pointed out
that you had told me what he wished to do and
what he wanted: "he wished to go to Spain, and
wanted a liberal allowance." As for the allowance,
I said I would give him as much as Publilius or
Lentulus the flamen gave their sons. Against Spain
I brought forward two arguments, the first, the one
I used to you, that I was afraid of adverse criticism:
"Was it not enough that we abandoned one side?
Must we take the other?" The second that he
would be annoyed, if his cousin enjoyed Caesar's
intimacy and general goodwill more than he did.
I should prefer him to make use of my liberal offer
rather than of his liberty. However I gave him
permission; for I saw you did not really dislike the
idea. I shall think the matter over carefully, and
I hope you will too. It is an important point: to

your grief, though it is a kindly weakness, should be

consolation, but this is the straightest: let reason

<p class='c000'>I am upset about Attica, though I agree with
Craterus. Brutus' letter, though full of wise saws
and friendliness, drew from me many tears. This
solitude stirs my grief less than your crowded city.
You are the only person I miss; but I find no more
difficulty about my literary work than if I were
at home. Still the old anguish oppresses me and
will not leave me, though I give you my word I
do not give way to it, but fight against it.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to what you say about Appuleius, I don't
think you need exert yourself, or trouble Balbus
and Oppius. He has promised them and told them
to let me know that he will not bother me at all.
But take care that my plea of ill-health is put in
every day. Laenas promised to certify. Add
C. Septimius, and L. Statilius. Indeed anyone you
ask will pass his word for it. But if there is any
difficulty, I will come and swear myself to chronic
ill-health. Since I am going to miss the banquets,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c008'><sup>[56]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>refuse. But see Septimius, Laenas and Statilius.
There must be three. However Laenas undertook
the whole matter for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>You say you have been dunned by Junius. Well
anyhow Cornificius is rich enough to pay: but I
should like to know when they say I went bail for
him, and whether it was for the father or the son.
Still for all that, do as you say, and see Cornificius'
agents and Appuleius the estate agent.</p>

<p class='c000'>You are as kind as usual in wishing that I could
get some relief from my grief; but you can bear
witness that it is no fault of mine. For every word
that has been written by anyone on the subject of
assuaging grief I read at your house. But my
sorrow is beyond any consolation. Why, I have
done what no one has ever done before, tried to
console myself by writing a book. I will send it
to you as soon as it is copied out. I assure you
no other consolation equals it. I write the whole
day long, not that it does any good, but it acts as
a temporary check: not very much of that, for
the violence of my grief is too strong; but still I
get some relief and try with all my might to attain
some composure of countenance, if not of mind.
In so doing sometimes I think I am doing wrong,
and sometimes that I should be doing wrong, if
I were not to do it. Solitude helps a little, but it
would have much more effect, if you at any rate
could be with me: and that is my only reason
for leaving, for the place is as right as any could
be under the circumstances. However even the
idea of seeing you upsets me: for now you can
never feel the same towards me. I have lost all
you used to love.</p>

<p class='c000'>In trying to escape from the painful sting of
recollection I take refuge in recalling something to
your memory. Whatever you think of it, please
pardon me. The fact is I find that some of the
authors over whom I am poring now, consider
appropriate the very thing that I have often discussed
with you, and I hope you approve of it. I
mean the shrine. Please give it all the attention
your affection for me dictates. For my part I have
no doubt about the design (I like Cluatius' design),
nor about the erection (on that I am quite determined);
but I have some doubts about the place.
So please consider it. I shall use all the opportunities
of this enlightened age to consecrate her
memory by every kind of memorial borrowed from
the genius of all the masters, Greek and Latin.
Perhaps it will only gall my wound: but I consider
myself pledged by a kind of vow or promise; and
I am more concerned about the long ages, when
I shall not be here, than about my short day, which,
short though it is, seems all too long to me. I have
tried everything and find nothing that gives me
rest. For, while I was engaged on the essay I
mentioned before, I was to some extent fostering
my grief. Now I reject everything and find nothing
more tolerable than solitude. Philippus has not
disturbed it as I feared: for after paying me a
visit yesterday he returned at once to Rome.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have sent you the letter I have written at your
suggestion to Brutus. Please have it delivered with
your own. However I have sent you a copy of it,</p>

points in which you found him wanting. But that
is his look out: though in one thing it shows disgraceful
ignorance on his part. He thinks Cato
was the first to deliver a speech for the punishment
of the conspirators, though everybody except Caesar
had spoken before him: and that, though Caesar's
speech, delivered from the praetorian bench, was so
severe, those of the ex-consuls, Catulus, Servilius,
the Luculli, Curio, Torquatus, Lepidus, Gellius,
Volcacius, Figulus, Cotta, L. Caesar, C. Piso, M'.
Glabrio, and even the consuls elect Silanus and
Murena, were milder. Why then was the division

up the same matter in clearer and fuller words. My

Brutus again seems to think he is giving me high

absent, or at any rate only for a certain time. Rest
assured that I have long held you at a higher value
than them all. Myself too I do not underrate, and
I far prefer to trust my own judgment than that of
all the rest. However I am not going further than
the wisest heads allow. I have not only read all
their writings on the point, which in itself shows
I am a brave invalid and take my medicine, but I
have transferred them to my own work; and that
certainly does not argue a mind crushed and enfeebled.
Do not call me back from these remedies
into that busy life, for fear I relapse.</p>

I must employ all my own resources and those of

can manage with my own. There are things I
could sell easily too. But without selling anything,
if I pay interest to the person from whom I buy for
no more than a year, I can get what I want, if you
assist me. The most available are those of Drusus,
as he wants to sell. The next I think are Lamia's;
but he is away. However scent out anything you
can. Silius again never uses his at all, and he will
very easily be satisfied with the interest. Regard

<p class='c000'>From the beginning of your letter "though I did
not care what happened in Spain, still you would
write," I thought you had some news from me: but
I see you have answered my letter only as regards
the forum and the Senate. But, you say, my house
at Rome is a forum. What is the good of the house
alone to me, if I have not the forum? I am dead
and done for, Atticus, and have been this long
while: but now I confess it, when I have lost the
one link that bound me to life. So what I want is
solitude. Still if in my despite anything drags me to
Rome, I shall strive, if possible (and I will make it

remember the questions Aledius asked you. They
are annoying to me even now. What do you
suppose they will be, if I come?</p>

<p class='c000'>Arrange about Terentia as you say, and rid me of
this addition—though not the weightiest—to my
weighty griefs and sorrows. To show you that my
sorrow is not prostration, you have entered in your
Chronicle the date of the visit of Carneades and
that famous embassy to Rome:<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c008'><sup>[66]</sup></a> I want to know
now the cause of its coming. I think it was about
Oropus: but I am not certain. And, if that is so,
what was the point in question? Further, who was
the most distinguished Epicurean of the time and
the head of the Garden at Athens; also who were
the famous politicians there? I think you can find
all those things in Apollodorus' book.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>It is annoying about Attica; but, as it is a mild
attack, I expect it will be all right. About Gamala
I had no doubt. For why was his father Ligus so
fortunate? Need I mention my own case, when I
am incapable of getting relief, though everything
I wish were to happen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The price you mention for Drusus' gardens I too
had heard, and had written about it to you, yesterday
I think. Whatever the price is, what is necessary is
cheap. In my eyes, whatever you may think—for
I know what I think of myself—it relieves my mind
of a bounden duty, if not of sorrow.</p>

valuation. Silius will not want show places and I
can make myself contented on the income I have,
though hardly on less. So where can I get ready
money? You can extort 5,000 guineas<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c008'><sup>[67]</sup></a> from Hermogenes,
especially as it will be necessary; and I find
I have another 5,000 by me. For the rest of the
money I will either pay interest to Silius, until I get
it from Faberius, or get the money to pay with at
once from some debtor of Faberius. There will be
some coming in too from other quarters. But you
can take charge of the whole matter. I much prefer
them to Drusus' gardens; indeed the two have
never been compared. Believe me I am actuated by
one single motive. I know I have gone silly about
it; but continue to bear with my folly. For it is no

<p class='c000'>You call me back to my old way of life. Well,
I have long been bewailing the loss of the Republic,
and that was what I was doing, though less strongly;
for I had one harbour of refuge. Now I positively
cannot follow my old way of life and employment;
nor do I think I ought to care what others think
about that. My own conscience is more to me than
all their talk. For the consolation I have sought in
writing, I am not discontented with my measure of
success. It has made me show my grief less; but the
grief itself I could not lessen, nor would I, if I could.</p>

<p class='c000'>About Triarius you interpret my wishes well.
However do nothing without his family's consent.
I love him, though he is dead: I am guardian to his
children, and feel affection for all his household. As
regards the business with Castricius, if he is willing to
take money estimated at its present rate instead of
the slaves, nothing could be more convenient. But,
if things have gone so far that he is taking the
slaves away, I don't think it is fair to him to ask him
(you ask me to give you my real opinion); for I
don't want my brother Quintus to have any bother,
and I rather fancy you take the same view. If
Publilius is waiting for the equinox, as you say
Aledius tells you, I suppose he is going by sea; but
he told me he was going by way of Sicily. I should
like to know which it is and when. I should like
you too some time at your convenience to pay a visit
to little Lentulus<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c008'><sup>[72]</sup></a> and assign him such of the

<p class='c000'>You say you will see Silius to-day; so to-morrow,
or as soon as you can, write, if anything comes of
your meeting. I am not trying to avoid Brutus,
though I don't expect to get any consolation from
him. But there are reasons why I do not want to
go there at this particular time. If those reasons
continue to exist, I shall have to find some excuse
to offer him, and by the look of things at present, I
think they will continue.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the gardens, please finish the business.
The main point is what you know. A further consideration
is that I myself want something of the
kind; for I cannot exist in a crowd, nor can I be far
from you. For my purpose I cannot see anything
better adapted than that particular place, and I
should like to know what your opinion is. I am
quite sure, especially as I see you think so too, that
Oppius and Balbus are very fond of me. Let them
know how eager I am for the gardens and why; but
that it is only possible, if the business with Faberius
is settled; and ask whether they will go bail for the
payment. Even if I must bear some loss in return
for getting ready money, draw them on as far as they
will go: for there is no chance of getting the full
debt. In fact, find out if they show any inclination
to assist my plan. If they do, it is a great assistance;
if not, we must manage somehow or other.
Look upon it as "a place to grow old in," to use
your own phrase, or if you like as a burial place for
me. It is no use thinking of the place at Ostium.
If we don't get this, I feel sure, we shall not get
Lamia's; so we must try for Damasippus' place.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am trying to find something to say to you; but
there is nothing. The same things every day. I am
much obliged to you for paying a visit to Lentulus.
Assign him as many slaves as you like and select
them yourself. As to Silius' inclination to sell and
his price, you seem to fear first that he won't want
to sell and secondly not at that price. Sicca thought
differently; but I agree with you. So, as he suggested,
I wrote to Egnatius. Silius wants you to
speak to Clodius. You have my full consent to do
so, indeed it is more convenient than for me to write
to Clodius myself, as he wanted. As to Castricius'
slaves I think it is most convenient that Egnatius
should carry the matter through,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c008'><sup>[73]</sup></a> as you say you
think he will. With Ovia please see that some
arrangement is made. As you say it was night

<p class='c000'>Sicca is surprised that Silius has changed his
mind. For my part I am more surprised that, when
he makes his son the excuse—and it seems to me a
good enough excuse, as his son is all he could wish—you
say you think he will sell, if we add one other
thing, which he shrinks from mentioning, though
he has set his heart on it.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c008'><sup>[74]</sup></a> You ask me to fix my</p>

reckoned rather by my need than by the market
value. However please consider whether I can get
them or not. If I were to sell my claim on Faberius,
I should have no doubt about settling for Silius'
gardens even with ready money, if only he could be
induced to sell. If his are not for sale, I should
have recourse to Drusus, even at the price Egnatius

like you to arrange the rest, so that we may supply
him with what is necessary from those rents. I will
guarantee that neither Bibulus nor Acidinus nor
Messalla, who I hear are at Athens, will spend more
than he will get out of those rents. So please see
who the tenants are and what they pay, secondly
that they are punctual payers, and what journey

<p class='c000'>It never occurred to me before I left you the
other day, that if anything is spent on a monument
in excess of whatever it is that the law allows, one
has to give an equal sum to the public funds. That
would not disturb me much, if it were not that
somehow or other, perhaps without any good reason,
I should be sorry for it to be called anything but a
shrine. If I want that, I'm afraid I can't have it,
unless I change the site. Please consider what
there is in this point. For though I am less anxious
and have almost recovered myself, still I want your
advice. So I entreat you with more urgency than
you wish or allow me to use, to give your whole
mind to considering this question.</p>

the actual house where she died; but, as I have
often said, I am afraid of its changing hands.
Wherever I build it in the open, I think I can
contrive that posterity shall respect its sanctity.

the way. I came to Astura straight from you.
Those cheerful friends of yours who blame me
cannot read as much as I have written. How
well it is written is not to the point, but it was
a kind of writing that no one whose spirit was
broken could do. I have been thirty days in these
gardens. Who has failed to get access to me or
conversation with me? At this very moment I
am writing and reading so much that the people
with me find the holiday harder work than I find
working. If anyone asks why I am not in town,
"because it is the vacation": why I am not at one
of my little places, where it is now the season,
"because I could not put up with the crowd of
visitors." So I am staying where the man, who
prized Baiae more than anyone, always used to
spend this part of the year. When I come to
Rome, they shall have nothing to find fault with
in my looks or my conversation. The cheerfulness
with which I used to temper the sadness of the
times, I have lost for ever: but there shall be no
lack of courage and firmness in my bearing or my
words.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to Scapula's gardens, it seems possible that,
as a favour, partly to you and partly to me, they
may be put up at auction. If not, we are cut

He is a very suitable person and very devoted to

for a purchaser? And that could be got through
any of the heirs. But I think Mustela will manage
that, if you ask him. You will have provided me
not only with the very place I want for my purpose,

<p class='c000'>About Mustela, do as you say, though it will be
a big business. For that reason I incline more to
Clodia; though in both cases we must find out
about Faberius' debt. There will be no harm in
your speaking to Balbus about it and telling him,
what is the truth, that we want to buy, but cannot
without getting in that debt, and dare not,
until something is settled. But when is Clodia
going to be in Rome, and how much do you think
it will cost? Why I turn my thoughts to it is not
that I should not prefer the other, but it is a big
venture and it is difficult to contend with one who
is eager for it, rich and one of the heirs. As far as
eagerness goes, I yield to no one, but in the other
respects we are worse off. However of this when
we meet.</p>

<p class='c000'>I felt all the time how much good your presence
was doing me: but I feel it still more since you have
gone. So, as I wrote to you before, either I must
come to you entirely or you to me, according as it
can be managed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yesterday, soon after your departure, I think,
some people, who looked like city men, brought
me a message and a letter from Gaius Marius, son
and grandson of Gaius.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c008'><sup>[84]</sup></a> He begged me in the
name of our relationship, in the name of Marius,
on whom I had written, and by the eloquence of
his grandfather, L. Crassus, to defend him: and he
stated his case in full. I wrote back that he had
no need of an advocate since his relative Caesar
was omnipotent, and he was the best and most
liberal of men: but I would support him. What
times these are! To think of Curtius wondering
whether to stand for the consulship. But enough
of this.</p>

veterinary surgeon, and was put to death by Antony after
he had set up a column in the forum in Caesar's memory.
Marius married Julia, aunt of Caesar; their son was adopted
by Gratidia, grandmother of Cicero, and married a daughter
of L. Crassus, the orator. Hence the claims of relationship
asserted in this letter.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am anxious about Tiro. But I shall know soon
how he is, for yesterday I sent a man to see, and
I gave him a letter to you too. I have sent you

to know when the auction is. I see you think the
letter ought to be sent to Caesar. Well, I thought
so too very strongly, especially as there is nothing
in it that the most loyal of citizens might not have
written; loyal, that is to say, in the present circumstances,
to which all politicians tell us we should
bow. But you know I thought your Caesarian
friends ought to read it first: so you must see to
that. But, unless you feel sure they approve of it,
it must not be sent. You will know whether they
really think so or are pretending. I shall count
pretence as rejection. You must probe that point.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tuditanus you mention, great-grandfather of
Hortensius, I had never heard of, and I thought it
was the son who was the ambassador, though he
could not have been at the time. I take it as
certain that Mummius was at Corinth. For Spurius,
who died lately, often used to recite to me letters
Mummius wrote to his friends from Corinth in clever
verse. But I have no doubt he was a special legate
to his brother, not among the ten ambassadors.
Here is another point too that I have been taught,
that it was not the custom of our ancestors to
appoint among the ten ambassadors anyone who was
related to the generals, as we in ignorance of, or
rather in contempt for, the soundest institutions did
in sending M. Lucullus and L. Murena and others
to L. Lucullus. But it was most natural that he
should be among the first of his brother's legates.

<p class='c000'>You had only just left yesterday, when Trebatius
came, and then Curtius shortly afterwards. The
latter only came to pay a call, but he stayed at my
invitation. Trebatius is with me too, and this
morning came Dolabella. We had a long talk till
late in the day. I cannot exaggerate his cordiality
and friendliness. However, we touched on young
Quintus. Much of what he told me was unmentionable,
unspeakable; but there was one thing so bad
that, if the whole army did not know of it, I should
not dare to dictate it to Tiro or even to write it
down myself. But enough of this.</p>

<p class='c000'>Torquatus came to me opportunely, while Dolabella
was with me, and Dolabella very kindly
repeated to him what I had just been saying. For
I had just been pleading his cause very earnestly;
and my earnestness seemed to please Torquatus
greatly. I am waiting to know if you have any
news about Brutus. However, Nicias thought that
the matter was settled, but that the divorce was
not approved. For that reason I am all the more
eager about the thing, as you are too. For, if any
offence has been given, this can remedy it.</p>

So one may fear anything. But fancy you of all
people making such a historical slip as to call me
the only surviving ex-consul. Why, what about
Servius? However, that of course has not the
slightest importance in any respect, least of all to
me, who think my dead comrades' fate quite as happy

Caesar of Marcellus' death. But no suspicion would
have fallen on Caesar, even if his death had been

to be mad, surely that accounts for everything. I
don't see his point at all. Perhaps you will explain.
However, there is nothing I am in doubt about

even gone security for him. That no doubt was the
point; he was insolvent. I suppose he asked some
favour of Marcellus, and the latter, as was his way,
gave a rather decided answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Please give your earnest consideration to deciding
whether what I have written ought to be sent to
Varro: though the point has some personal interest
for you too: for you must know I have brought you
in as a third speaker in the dialogue. So I think we
must consider. The names, however, have been entered,
but they can be scratched out or altered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pray tell me how Attica is. It is three days since I
heard from you, and no wonder: for no one has come
here, and perhaps there was no reason for writing.
So I myself have nothing to write. However, I am
expecting one of my messengers the very day I am
giving this to Valerius. If he comes and brings
something from you, I foresee I shall have no lack

make life more endurable, at present I have not
stirred a foot away from the house; we have had
such heavy and continuous rain. The "Academic
Treatise" I have transferred entirely to Varro. At
first it was assigned to Catulus, Lucullus, and Hortensius;
then, as that seemed inappropriate because
they were well-known not to be up in such matters,
though not illiterate, as soon as I came here I transferred
the conversations to Cato and Brutus. Then
came your letter about Varro and he seemed the
most appropriate person possible to air Antiochus'</p>

<p class='c000'>I was expecting some news from Rome on the

What is Brutus thinking of doing, or, if he has done

why do I ask about these things, when I care very
little about them? I do want to know how our dear
Attica is getting on. Though your letter (but that

am anxious for fresh news.</p>

Certainly let us settle about the gardens. We seemed
to be talking to one another, when I was at Tusculum,
so frequent was the interchange of letters. But that
will be the same again soon. Meantime I have taken
your hint and finished off some really quite clever
books for Varro. But I am waiting for your answer
to my questions: first, how you knew he wanted
anything from me, when in spite of his voluminous
writings he has never challenged me; and next, who
it was of whom he was jealous, unless it may have
been Brutus. If he is not jealous of him, he certainly
cannot be of Hortensius or the speakers in the <cite>De Republica.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>The copyist Hilarus had just left on the 28th, and
I had given him a letter to you, when your messenger
came with your letter of the day before. What
I was most glad to see in it was the sentence "Our
dear Attica begs you not to be anxious" and your
own statement that there is no danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>I see your influence has given my speech for
Ligarius a good start. For Balbus has written to
me with Oppius, saying that he is extraordinarily
pleased with it; and for that reason he has sent the
little thing to Caesar. So that is what you wrote to
me some time ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Varro's case I should not be disturbed about
appearing to be tuft-hunting—for my principle has
always been not to insert any living characters in
my dialogues; but it was because you say Varro
wants it, and appreciates the compliment, that I
have finished off the work and have comprised the
whole of the Academic philosophy—how well I cannot
say, but with all possible care—in four books.
All the fine array of arguments against the uncertainty
of apperceptions collected by Antiochus I
have given to Varro; I answer him myself, and you

suaviter fit, ut et Heraclides in multis et nos in
<span class='fss'>VI</span> "de re publica" libris fecimus. Sunt etiam "de
oratore" nostri tres mihi vehementer probati. In eis
quoque eae personae sunt, ut mihi tacendum fuerit.
Crassus enim loquitur, Antonius, Catulus senex,
C. Iulius, frater Catuli, Cotta, Sulpicius. Puero me
hic sermo inducitur, ut nullae esse possent partes
meae. Quae autem his temporibus scripsi, Ἀριστοτέλειον
morem habent, in quo sermo ita inducitur
ceterorum, ut penes ipsum sit principatus. Ita confeci
quinque libros περὶ τελῶν, ut Epicurea L. Torquato,
Stoica M. Catoni, περιπατητικὰ M. Pisoni darem.
Ἀζηλοτύπητον id fore putaram, quod omnes illi decesserant.
Haec "Academica," ut scis, cum Catulo,
Lucullo, Hortensio contuleram. Sane in personas
non cadebant; erant enim λογικώτερα quam ut illi
de iis somniasse umquam viderentur. Itaque, ut legi
tuas de Varrone, tamquam ἕρμαιον arripui. Aptius
esse nihil potuit ad id philosophiae genus, quo ille
maxime mihi delectari videtur, easque partes, ut non
sim consecutus, ut superior mea causa videatur. Sunt
enim vehementer πιθανὰ Antiochia; quae diligenter
a me expressa acumen habent Antiochi, nitorem
orationis nostrum, si modo is est aliquis in nobis.
Sed tu, dandosne putes hos libros Varroni, etiam
atque etiam videbis. Mihi quaedam occurrunt; sed
ea coram.</p>

</div>
<div class='english-page'>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>should have been a mere lay figure. That suits
admirably when the characters are persons of olden
times; and that is what Heraclides often did in his
works; and I myself did so in my six books <cite>De
Republica</cite>. It is the same, too, in my three books
<cite>De Oratore</cite>, of which I think very highly; in them,
too, the characters were such that I could properly
keep silent. For the speakers are Crassus, Antonius,
old Catulus, his brother C. Julius, Cotta and
Sulpicius; and the conversation is supposed to take
place when I was a boy, so that I could have no part
in it. But in a modern work, I follow Aristotle's
practice: the conversation of the others is so put
forward as to leave him the principal part. I
arranged the five books <cite>De Finibus</cite> so as to give
the Epicurean parts to L. Torquatus, the Stoic to
M. Cato, and the Peripatetic to M. Piso. I thought
that could not make anybody jealous, as they were
all dead. This present work, the <cite>Academica</cite>, as you
know, I had shared between Catulus, Lucullus and
Hortensius. I must admit that the work did not
suit the characters; for it was far too philosophical
for them to have ever dreamt of such things. So,
when I read your note about Varro, I jumped at it
as a godsend. Nothing could have been more appropriate
for expounding the system of philosophy in
which he seems to be specially interested, and for
introducing a part which prevents me from seeming
to give my own cause the superiority. For the
views of Antiochus are very persuasive, and I have
put them carefully with all Antiochus' acuteness
and my own polished style, if I possess one. But
do you consider carefully, whether you think I ought
to dedicate the books to Varro. Some objections
occur to me; but of that when we meet.</p>

on Lucilius: "Pull up chariot and horses as a good
driver oft does." And Carneades always compares
the philosopher's suspension of judgment (ἐποχή) to
the guard of a boxer and the pulling up of a
charioteer. But the <em>inhibitio</em> of rowers implies
motion, and indeed the rather violent motion of
rowing to back the boat. You see how much more
attention I pay to this than either to rumour or
to Pollio. Let me know too about Pansa, if anything
definite is known, and I suppose it has come out,
about Critonius, if there is any news, and anyhow

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>I am in such a hurry to send what I have written
to Varro, as you suggested, that I have sent it already
to Rome to be copied. If you like, you shall have
it at once. For I wrote to my copyist telling them
to give your people leave to copy, if you liked.
Please keep it, however, till I see you. You are
generally most careful to do so, when I have told
you. I was nearly forgetting to say that Caerellia,
inspired of course by love of philosophy, is copying
from your people<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c008'><sup>[121]</sup></a>; she has those very books <cite>De
Finibus</cite>. I assure you, so far as it is humanly possible
to affirm anything, that she did not get it from mine,
for my copy was never out of my sight. So far were
my people from making two copies, that they could
scarcely make up one. However, I am not finding any
fault in your people, and I hope you will not either,
for I omitted to say that I did not want the books
circulated yet. Dear me, how I do harp on trifles.

<p class='c000'>I agree about Dolabella. My co-heirs I will meet
at Tusculum, as you suggest. As to Caesar's arrival,
Balbus has written that he won't be here till the
first of August. It is good news that Attica's
attack gets slighter and slighter and that she is
bearing it cheerfully. As to that idea of ours, about
which I am quite as eager as you are, so far as I
know anything about the man, I approve of him,
his family, and his fortune. What is most important
is that, though I do not know him himself, I hear
very well of him, even quite recently from Scrofa.
If it is of any importance, one may add that he is even
better bred than his father. So we will speak of it
when we meet, and I am disposed to approve. For
in addition, as I think you know, I am with good
reason and long have been fonder of his father than
either you or he himself is aware.</p>

fault and I bring no charge against you; but there
was something different that I did mention in a

have got from you. In Balbus' case I realize of

that Brutus should get anything stale or Balbus

he did not wish me to come to Rome now just to pay
my respects to him—but, as you say you have read
the letter, perhaps I was not quite clear. However,
as I am just on the point of coming, please see that
my presence on the 15th does not prevent his coming
to Tusculum at his convenience. For I shall not
want him at the auction—surely in such a business
you alone will be enough: but I do want him when
I make my will. That I would rather postpone for
another day now, so as not to seem to have come
to Rome expressly for that purpose. So I have
written to Brutus now that I shall not want him, as
I had thought, on the 15th. I should like you to
look after all this and see that we don't inconvenience
Brutus in the least.</p>

frightened at my bidding you send the books to
Varro on your own responsibility? Even now, if you
have any doubts, let me know. Nothing could be
more finished than they are. I want Varro, especially
as he desires it: but, as you know, he is "a fearsome
man; the blameless he would blame." I often picture
him to myself complaining of this perhaps,
that my side in the books is more fully defended
than his own, though I assure you, if ever you come
to Epirus, I will convince you it is not. For at present
I have to give way to Alexio's<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c008'><sup>[133]</sup></a> letters. However,
I don't despair of winning Varro's approval;

<p class='c000'>As for the letter to Caesar, I was always ready to
let your friends read it first. If I had not been, I
should not have done my duty by them, and should
very nearly have imperilled myself, if I were likely
to offend him. But they have acted frankly, and I
am thankful to them for not concealing their feelings;
but the best thing of all is that they want
to make so many alterations that there is no sense
in my writing it all over again. However, what view
ought I to have taken of the Parthian war except
what I thought he wanted? Indeed what other
purpose had my letter save to kowtow to him? Do
you suppose I should have been at a loss for words,
if I had wanted to give him the advice which I
really thought best? So the whole letter is unnecessary.
For, when I cannot make a <em>coup</em>, and
a fiasco, however slight, would be unpleasant, why
should I run unnecessary risk? Especially as it
occurs to me that, as I have not written before, he
would think I should not have written until the
whole war were over. Besides I am afraid he may
think it is to sugar the pill of my Cato. In fact I am
very sorry I wrote it, and nothing could suit my
wishes better than that they do disapprove of my
zeal. I should have fallen foul of<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c008'><sup>[136]</sup></a> Caesar's party, and

About the letter to Caesar, I give you my word of
honour I cannot; it is not the shame of the thing
that prevents me, though that is just what ought.
Ah, how shameful is flattery, when life alone is a
disgrace! But, as I was beginning to say, it is not
the shame of it that prevents me—I only wish it
were, for then I should be the man I ought to be—but
I cannot think of anything to write. Just consider
the subjects of the letters of advice addressed
to Alexander by men of eloquence and learning.
Here was a youth fired by a desire for the truest
glory and desiring to have some advice given him on
the subject of eternal fame, and they exhort him to
follow honour. There is plenty to say on that: but
what can I say? However, from hard material I had
rough hewn something that seemed to me to take
shape. Because there were a few touches in it a
little better than the actual facts past or present,
fault is found with them; and I don't regret it a bit.

me, I should have regretted it. Why, don't you</p>

the larger bath and thinks the smaller could be
made into a winter snuggery. So a covered passage
would have to be added, and, if I made one the
same size as that at my place at Tusculum, the cost
would be about half as much in that district. However,
for the erection we want to make nothing
could be more suitable than the grove, which I used
to know well; then it was not at all frequented,
now I hear it is very much so. There is nothing
I should prefer. In this, humour my whim, in
heaven's name. For the rest, if Faberius pays that

But in his letter there was no news except that the
auction lasts two days. So you will come after it, as
you say, and I hope the business with Faberius will
be settled. Eros thinks he will not settle up to-day,

But in Libo's annals Tuditanus was praetor
fourteen years after Mummius' consulship. That does
not square at all. I am thinking of writing a kind
of political conference, held at Olympia or wherever
you like, like that of your friend Dicaearchus.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the letter to Caesar I have made up my
mind; and yet precisely what they say he says in
his letter, that he will not go against the Parthians
until affairs are arranged here, is what I advised in
my letter. I told him he could do whichever he
chose with my full leave. For of course he wants
that and won't do anything without my advice. For
heaven's sake let us give up flattery and be at least
half-free; and that we can manage by keeping quiet
and out of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>But approach Otho, as you say, and finish that
business, my dear Atticus. For I don't see any other
way of keeping away from the forum and yet being
with you. As to the price, this has just occurred
to me. The nearest neighbour is C. Albanius. He
bought some 600 acres<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c008'><sup>[145]</sup></a> of M. Pilius, so far as I can
recollect for £110,000.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c008'><sup>[146]</sup></a> Of course everything has
gone down in value now. But on the other side
counts our eagerness to purchase, though I don't
suppose we shall have anyone bidding against us
except Otho. Him however you can influence personally,
and could still more easily, if you had Canus
with you. What senseless gluttony!<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c008'><sup>[147]</sup></a> Shame on

of the Tiber is to be diverted from the Mulvian
bridge along the Vatican hills; the Campus Martius
to be built over, and the Vatican plain to be a sort
of Campus Martius. "What's that?" I said. "Why,
I was going to the sale to buy Scapula's gardens,
if I could safely." "Don't you do it," he told me;
"for the law will be passed: Caesar wants it." I
was not disturbed at hearing it: but I should be
annoyed, if they do it. What have you got to
say about it? However I need not ask. You
know how eager a news-monger Capito is: not
even Camillus can beat him at that. So you must
let me know about the auction on the 15th: for
that is what is bringing me to town. I have combined
some other things with it: but those I can
easily do two or three days later. However I don't
want you to be tired out with travelling: nay, I
even excuse Dionysius. As to what you say about
Brutus, I have left it open so far as I am concerned:
for yesterday I wrote and told him that I should

<p class='c000'>As I was writing against the Epicureans before
daybreak, I scribbled something or other to you
by the same lamp and at the same sitting and
despatched it before daybreak. Then as I was
getting up with the sun after another sleep, I get
a letter from your sister's son, which I enclose.
The beginning of it is most insulting: but perhaps
he did not stop to think. This is how it runs:
"For, whatever there is to be said to your discredit,
I...." He wants me to understand there is plenty
to be said to my discredit, but he does not agree
with it. Could anything be more disgusting? You
may read the rest (for I have sent it on) and judge
for yourself. I fancy it is the daily and continual
complimentary remarks which, as I hear from many,
our friend Brutus is making about us, which have
provoked him into writing something to me and to
you—let me know if he has written to you. For
what he has written to his father about me I don't
know: about his mother how affectionately! "I
should have liked," he says, "to be with you as
much as possible and to have a house taken for
me somewhere: and so I told you. You took no
notice: so we shall not be together much: for I
cannot bear the sight of your house: you know
why." His father tells me the reason is his hatred
of his mother. Now, Atticus, help me with your
advice. "By honest means shall I the high wall
climb?"<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c008'><sup>[163]</sup></a> that is to say shall I openly renounce and</p>

where will he find them, unless, perhaps, he hangs

It is excellent to hear that not even the man who
began the whole criminal business has a good word

<p class='c000'>I sent Quintus your letter for your sister. When
he complained that his son was at daggers drawn with
his mother and said he should give up the house to
his son on that account, I said young Quintus had sent
an amiable letter to his mother and none to you.
He was surprised at the first, but said it was his
fault about you, as he had often written in anger to
his son about your unfairness to him. However, he
said his anger had abated, so I read your letter, and
"by crooked ways" hinted that I should not bear
malice. For then he began to mention Cana.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c008'><sup>[170]</sup></a> To
be sure, if that plan found favour, we should have
to make it up; but, as you say, we must consider
our dignity, and we ought to concert our plans
together, though his attacks on me were the worst
and certainly the most public. If Brutus, too,
should come to our aid, we need not hesitate. But
we must discuss it together; for it is an important
matter and requires great caution. So to-morrow,

to compel you then?" I said. "Debt," said he,
"and yet not enough money for the journey." At
that point I borrowed something from your style of
eloquence: I held my tongue. Well, he went on,
"But what worries me most is my uncle." "Why?"
said I. "Because he is angry with me," he answered.
"Why do you let him be so?" I said, "for I would
rather put it that way than say, Why do you make
him angry?" "I will not let him," he said, "for I
will remove the reason." I replied, "Very right of
you, too; but, if it is not a serious matter, I should
like to know what the reason is." "Because my hesitation
which wife I should take annoyed my mother,
and consequently him, too. Now nothing is worth

The people were splendid not even to clap Victory

to Caesar. I assented; but the procession
puts me off. Have you really dared to send my
book to Varro! I am eager for his opinion. But
when will he finish reading it? I agree about
Attica. It is something that the spirits are relieved
by the spectacle and by the general feeling of religious
associations. I wish you would send me
Cotta; I have Libo and before that I had Casca.
Brutus brought me a message from T. Ligarius that
the mention of L. Corfidius in my speech for
Ligarius is a mistake. But it is a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapsus memoriae</span></i>,

<p class='c000'>Yesterday evening I had a letter from Lepidus
at Antium. That is where he is, for he has the
house I sold. He implores me to be in the Senate
on the 1st, saying that both he and Caesar would
take it as a great favour. I don't think it is of
any importance; for Oppius would probably have
said something to you, as Balbus is ill. However
I would rather come for nothing, if necessary,
than have my absence noticed. I should regret
it afterwards. So to-day I go to Antium, to-morrow
home by midday. I should like you and
Pilia to come to dinner on the last of the month,
if you are not engaged.</p>

<p class='c000'>I hope you have settled with Publilius. I shall
rush back to Tusculum on the 1st; for I prefer
all the transactions with them to take place in
my absence. I am sending my brother's letter to
you: it is not a very kind answer to mine, but
I think it should satisfy you. You will see for yourself.</p>

I caught some remark of yours about coming to

you would: but at your convenience.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lepta asks me to go to him, if there is any

is heir to one-twelfth of his estate—though I know
nothing yet: but Lepta to a third. He is afraid he
may not be allowed to take the inheritance. It is
absurd of course, but still he is afraid. So, if he
sends for me, I shall go at once: if not, not till it
is necessary. Send back Pollex, when you can.</p>

it at all against the sons of Cn. Octavius; but
for Phamea's sake I agreed.<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c008'><sup>[181]</sup></a> For, if you remember,
when I was standing for the consulship, he sent a
promise of any assistance he could render through
you; and I appreciated it as much as if I had
used it. He came to me and said the judge had
undertaken to hear his case on the very same
day that the jury were bound by the Pompeian
law to settle that of our friend Sestius. For you
know the days of those cases have been fixed by
law. I answered that he could not but be aware
of my obligations to Sestius. If he would choose
any other day, I would not fail him. So then he
left me in a temper. I think I told you about
it. I did not bother myself about it of course,
not thinking that a perfectly unwarrantable fit of
anger of a stranger concerned me. However I told
Gallus the next time I was in town what I had
heard, without mentioning young Balbus. Gallus
took the matter up, as he tells me. He says
Tigellius asserts that I suspect him because of my
bad conscience about my desertion of Phamea.
Accordingly I commission you to find out what
you can from young Balbus, but not to bother
your head about me. It is quite a good thing to
have somebody to hate with a will, and not to
pander to everybody any more than to be asleep
for everybody.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c008'><sup>[182]</sup></a> Though upon my word, as you

<p class='c000'>You suggested in one of your letters that I
should set about composing a longer letter to send
to Caesar, and Balbus told me lately at Lanuvium
that he and Oppius had written to Caesar telling
him I had read his books against Cato and strongly
approved of them: so I wrote a letter to Caesar
about those books to be sent to Dolabella. But
I sent a copy to Oppius and Balbus, asking them
to send on my letter to Dolabella, if they themselves
approved of the copy. So they have answered
that they never read anything better and have had
my letter forwarded to Dolabella.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vestorius has written asking me to make over
my share in the property of Brinnius to a slave
of his on behalf of one Hetereius, so that he can
complete the transfer at Puteoli according to law.
If you think it right, send the slave to me; for
I suppose Vestorius has written to you too.</p>

<p class='c000'>About Caesar's coming Oppius and Balbus tell
me the same as you. I am surprised that you have
not yet had a talk with Tigellius. For instance,
I should much like to know just how much he got;
however I don't really care a straw. You ask what
I think about going to meet Caesar. Where are
you thinking of, unless it is Alsium? Indeed I
have written to Murena asking him to take me
in; but I suppose he has gone with Matius. So
I shall inflict myself on Sallustius.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I had written the last line, Eros told me
Murena gave him the kindest of answers: so let me
make use of him. For Silius has no cushions, while
Dida, I believe, has given up his whole villa to guests.</p>

hopeless. "For, if Caesar with his genius could not
find a solution, who will find it now?" In a word
he said the end had come (which may be true, but
he was pleased about it), and assured me that in less
than twenty days there would be a rising in Gaul.
He has not discussed the matter with anyone except
Lepidus since the 15th of March: and, in fine, things
cannot pass off like this. What a wise man is Oppius!
He regrets Caesar quite as much, but says nothing
that can offend any of the loyal party. So much
for that.</p>

not so bald as you think. For he has advanced,
though not very far. I have been detained too long

to him, when I went to see him at Sestius'

<p class='c000'>From your letters I have learned much about politics.
I had a whole batch of them at the same time
from the freedman of Vestorius. However, I will
answer your questions shortly. Firstly, I am delighted
about the Cluvian property. You ask why I sent for
Chrysippus. Two of my shops have fallen down and
the rest are cracking: so not only the tenants, but
even the mice, have migrated. Other people call it
a calamity, but I don't count it even a nuisance. O
Socrates and followers of Socrates, I can never thank
you sufficiently. Ye gods! how insignificant I count
all such things. However, at the advice and on
the suggestion of Vestorius I have adopted a plan
of rebuilding which will make my loss a profit.</p>

me to be likely to continue for some considerable

with a large force, and so Caecilius was snatched
from his hands and he lost many men. For that he
blames Volcacius. So I suppose there is a war imminent
there. But that is Dolabella's and Nicias'
look out. Balbus also has better news about Gaul.
Twenty-one days ago he had a letter that the Germans
and the tribes there, on hearing about Caesar, sent
ambassadors to Aurelius, who was appointed by Hirtius,
saying that they would do as they were bidden.

Philippus does not, and so I do not either. I hold that
it is impossible for a loyal citizen to do so. We are
surrounded by so many who threaten death to our
friends, and declare they cannot bear the present
state of affairs. What do you think will happen,
when this boy comes to Rome, where those who
have set us free cannot live in safety. They, indeed,
will ever be famous, and even happy in the consciousness
of their deed. But we, unless I am much
mistaken, shall be crushed. So I long to go "where
no bruit of the sons of Pelops may reach my ears,"<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c008'><sup>[205]</sup></a>

<p class='c000'>The letter you sent on the 19th did not reach me
for seven days. In it you ask whether I take more
pleasure in hills and a view or a walk by the silver
sea, and you seem to think I may not know myself.
Upon my word, both are so beautiful, as you say,
that I doubt which to prefer. "But no thought have
we of the service of a dainty meal; nay, seeing a
woeful heavy bane sent on us by heaven, we shudder
in doubt whether we shall be saved or perish."
For although you have sent me great and welcome
news about D. Brutus having joined his troops, in
which I see great hopes, still, if there is going to be
civil war—and that there must be, if Sextus stays
under arms, as I know for certain he will—I don't
know what we are to do. For now there will be
no chance of sitting on the fence, as there was in
Caesar's war. For, if this gang of ruffians thinks
anyone was rejoiced at the death of Caesar—and
we all of us showed our joy quite openly—they will
count him an enemy; and that looks like a considerable
massacre. Our alternative is to take refuge in
Sextus' camp, or join ourselves to Brutus if we can.
That is a hateful business and unsuitable for our age,</p>

Now come to my aid in settling a point which is
causing me anxiety. So much to be said on both
sides occurs to me. If I set off, as I intended, on
a free embassy to Greece, it seems as though I might
avoid to some extent the danger of a massacre which
is threatening, but I shall not escape some blame for
deserting the state in such a crisis. On the other hand,
if I stay, I see I shall be in danger, but I suspect there
is a possibility that I may help the State. There are
also private considerations, that I think it would be
of great use in settling my son down if I went to
Athens; and that was the only reason for my going,
when I had the idea of getting the offer of an embassy
from Caesar. So consider every side of the

you can easily imagine the proposal is so unprincipled,
so disgraceful, and so mischievous, that at times one
almost wishes for Caesar back again. For things that
Caesar never would have done, nor allowed to be
done, are now being brought forward from forged
notes of his. However, I have shown myself quite
complaisant to Antonius. For when he has once got
it into his head that he may do what he chooses, he
would have done it just as readily against my will.

then only to use his favour if you allowed. So I am
now the more anxious that you may let me do it
with your permission. But, if you show yourself
hard-hearted to his affliction and misery, I will not
contend with you, though I think I ought to observe
Caesar's memoranda. But upon my word, if you are
ready to take a generous, philosophical, and amiable
view of my actions, you will, I am sure, show your
indulgence, and will wish that most promising youth,
P. Clodius, to think that you did not act spitefully
to his father's friends when you had the chance. I
beseech you to let it seem that your feud with his
father was on public grounds, not because you despised
the family. For we can lay aside quarrels we
took up on public grounds with more honour and
more readiness than those that come from a personal
insult. So give me a chance of inculcating this lesson,
and while the boy's mind is still receptive, let us
convince him that quarrels should not be handed
down from generation to generation. Though I
know your fortune, Cicero, is above any danger,
yet I think you would rather enjoy old age with
peace and honour than with anxiety. Finally I
feel a right to ask you this favour, for I have done
all I could for your sake. If I do not gain it, I
shall not grant Clodius his restoration, so that you
may understand how much your authority weighs
in my eyes, and that may make you all the more
placable.</p>

personally the request you are making by letter.
Then you could have seen my affection for you not
only from what I said, but from my "expression,
eyes and brow," as the phrase goes. For I have
always had an affection for you, urged thereto at
first by your attention to me and afterwards by
benefits received, and in these days public affairs
have so recommended you to me that there is no
one for whom I have more regard. The letter you
have written to me in such a friendly and flattering
tone makes me feel as though I were receiving a
favour from you, not granting one to you, since you
refuse to recall your friend, who was my enemy,
against my will, though you could quite easily do
so. Of course I grant your request, my dear Antony,
and I think myself, too, most liberally and honourably
treated, when you address me in such a strain.
I should have thought it right to grant it you freely,
whatever the facts had been, and besides, I am gratifying
my own natural kindliness. For I never had
any bitterness or even the slightest sternness or
severity in me, except what was demanded by public
necessity. Besides, I never had any special grudge
against Clodius himself, and I always laid down the
rule that one should not attack one's enemies' friends,
especially their humbler friends, nor should we ourselves
be deprived of such supporters. As regards the
boy Clodius I think it is your duty to imbue his
"receptive mind," as you say, with the idea that</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r210'>210</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Vestorius was a banker (cf. <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> 12), and Atticus had

"grasping." The allusion to the Pheriones is inexplicable.</p>

<p class='c000'>You defend Brutus and Cassius as though you
thought I blamed them, though I cannot find praise
enough for them. It is the weak points of the situation,
not of the persons that I put together. For
though the tyrant is dead, I see the tyranny persists.
For things that he would not have done are being
done now, as, for example, the recalling of Clodius—a
thing I am sure he had no intention of doing
and would not even have allowed to be done. Vestorius'
enemy Rufio will follow, and Victor, whose
name was never in Caesar's notes, and the rest; every
one in fact. We could not be Caesar's slaves, but
we bow down to his note-books. For who dared
absent himself from the Senate on the Liberalia?<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c008'><sup>[211]</sup></a>
Suppose it had been possible somehow: even when
we did come, could we speak our mind freely? Had
we not to take precious good care of the veterans,
who were there under arms, since we had no support
ourselves. You can bear witness that that sitting
still on the Capitol was not approved by me. Well,
was that the fault of Brutus and the rest? Not a
bit of it: it was the fault of the other brute beasts,
who think themselves cautious and canny. They
thought it enough to rejoice, some of them to go so
far as to congratulate, none to stand their ground.
But let us put the past behind us: let us guard our
heroes with all our care and protection: and, as you
say, let us be content with the Ides of March. That
day gave our friends, who are more than men, an
entrance to heaven, but it did not give freedom to</p>

<p class='c000'>Well done my Dolabella! For now I call him
mine: up to now, you know, I had some doubts.
This will make people open their eyes—hurling
from the rock, crucifixion, pulling down the column<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c008'><sup>[213]</sup></a>
and ordering the place to be paved. Why, these
are heroic deeds. I take it he has put an end
to this feigning of regret, which up to now was
creeping on day by day, and, if it became a habit,
I was afraid it might be dangerous to our tyrannicides.
Now I quite agree with your letter and
hope for better things. However I cannot put
up with the people who under a pretence of wishing
for peace defend criminal actions. But still
we can't have everything at once. Things are
beginning to get better than I had expected, and
of course I will not go away, unless you think I
can do so honourably. My friend Brutus certainly
I will never desert; and I should act in the same
way, even if there were no ties between us, on
account of his extraordinary and incredible strength
of character.</p>

to the skies, and in the same breath offer me

need no advice, still I do not entirely assent, lest

antequam me plane salutavit, "O mi Cicero," inquit,

Atque haec una vox omnium est. A te autem

gloriae sinas cernere meque aliqua ex parte in societatem
tuarum laudum venire patiare. Quamquam,
mi Dolabella, (haec enim iocatus sum) libentius omnes

Nam, cum te semper tantum dilexerim, quantum tu
intellegere potuisti, tum his tuis factis sic incensus
sum, ut nihil umquam in amore fuerit ardentius.
Nihil est enim, mihi crede, virtute formosius, nihil

the king of kings, to have some Nestor to assist
in your plans; while it would redound to my
glory that you with your brilliant reputation as
a consul while still so young should be thought a
pupil of my training. Indeed L. Caesar, when I
paid him a visit on his sick bed at Naples, though
he was racked with pains all over his body, had
hardly finished his first greeting before he said:
"My dear Cicero, I congratulate you on the influence
you have with Dolabella. If I had had as much
with my sister's son,<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c008'><sup>[215]</sup></a> we might have been safe now.
Dolabella himself I both congratulate and thank:
indeed he is the first consul since yourself who can
really be called a consul." Then he had much to
say about the incident and your achievement. No
more splendid and magnificent deed was ever done,
nor any more salutary to the state: and that is what
the whole world is saying with one voice. I beg you
to let me enter into this false heritage of another's
glory, and suffer me to share your praises in some
slight degree. However, my dear Dolabella, so far I
have only been joking, and, if I have any reputation
myself, I would rather turn its full stream upon
you, than divert any part of yours upon myself.
For, though I have always been as fond of you
as you must have realized, now by your actions
my fondness has been fanned into the most ardent
love that is possible. For, believe me, there is
nothing fairer than virtue, nothing more beautiful,
nothing more loveable. I have always loved M.
Brutus, as you know, for his great ability, his
most agreeable manners, his extraordinary uprightness</p>

March my affection was so enhanced that I wondered
there was any room for increase in what
I had long thought had reached its culminating
point. Who would have thought that there could
be any increase in the affection I have for you?
But there has been such an increase that I seem
to myself now to love, while before I only liked.
So what need is there that I should exhort you
to have a regard for your dignity and glory? Shall
I do what people generally do when exhorting
others, set before your eyes distinguished examples?
There is none more distinguished than your own.
You must imitate yourself and vie with yourself.
Indeed, after such an achievement, you dare not fail
to be like yourself. As that is so, exhortation is
unnecessary and congratulation is more in place.
For you have had the fortune, which I doubt if
anyone else ever had, that great severity in punishment
should not only bring no ill will, but should
be popular and most pleasing to all, both of the
upper and of the lower class. If this had happened
to you by a stroke of fortune, I should congratulate
you on your luck: but it has happened through
your greatness of heart, yes, and of ability and
of prudence. For I have read your harangue.
Nothing could have been more skilful. You led up
to the case so gradually and gently, and then left
it again, that by universal consent the facts themselves
showed it was high time to resort to punitive
measures. So you freed the city from danger and
the state from fear, and you performed a sound
service not only to meet the emergency but to
serve as a precedent. After that you ought to
understand that the republic is in your hand, and</p>

<p class='c000'>You are continually reproaching me now with
lauding Dolabella to the skies more than I ought.
But, though I strongly approve of his action, still
it was one and then another letter of yours which
induced me to belaud it so highly. But Dolabella
has entirely lost your good graces for the same
reason that he has made me too a bitter enemy.
What a shameless fellow! He has not paid yet,
though he ought to have done so on the first of
January, especially as he has freed himself from
enormous debts by the handwriting of Faberius
and has sought help from the goddess of help.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c008'><sup>[216]</sup></a>

I am seriously concerned. I had written too to
him very early on the 8th, and on the same day
in the evening I got a letter from you at Pompeii,
delivered very quickly on the third day after
you wrote it. But, as I told you then, my letter
to Dolabella was sufficiently stinging. If it takes
no effect, I don't think he will be able to face me.</p>

when he was leaving; and my despair quite equals
his. What our friend Brutus is going to do in
the Forum, incomparable hero though he is, if he
is not going to attend the Senate on the first of
June, I do not know. But he should know this
better himself. From the things I see in course
of preparation I don't think the Ides of March
are going to help much. So I am daily thinking
more and more of Greece. For I fail to see what
use I can be to Brutus, who, as he writes to
me, is meditating exile. Leonidas' letter did not
give me much pleasure. I agree about Herodes. I
should like to have read Saufeius' note. I am thinking
of leaving Pompeii on the tenth of May.</p>

what you wrote), lo and behold your letter and
Brutus'. Brutus is meditating exile. I however
see another haven and a readier one for my age: but
I would rather sail into it with Brutus in prosperity
and the republic set in order. But now, as you say,
I have not the choice. For you agree that age unfits
me for a soldier's camp, especially in civil war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Antony only answered about Clodius, that my
leniency and clemency had been very gratifying
to him and would be a source of pleasure to myself.
But Pansa appears to be in a fury about Clodius
and about Deiotarus too; and, if you are willing
to believe him, he expresses himself very forcibly.
But there is one thing that to my mind is shady,
that he strongly disapproves of Dolabella's action.
As for the people who wore garlands, when your
nephew was reproved for it by his father, he
answered that he wore a garland for Caesar's
honour, and laid it aside for grief; and finally
that he would willingly submit to reproaches for
loving Caesar even after his death.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Dolabella I have written carefully, as you
advise: and I have written myself to Sicca too.
I do not want to lay this burden on you, for I
don't want him to be angry with you. I recognise
Servius' way of talking; and there seems to me
to be more fright than wisdom in it. But, since
we are all frightened, I agree with Servius.

to them all. First, my thanks for what you have
done in my affairs both in payment and in the
business with Albius. Then with regard to your
Buthrotum, when I was at Pompeii, Antony came
to Misenum: but he was gone again to Samnium,
before I heard he had come. See that you do
not build much hope on him. So I must see to
Buthrotum at Rome. L. Antonius' speech is horrible,
Dolabella's splendid. Let him keep his
money now, provided he pays on the Ides. I am
sorry about Tertulla's<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c008'><sup>[222]</sup></a> miscarriage. For we want
a crop of Cassii as much as one of Bruti. I hope
it is true about Cleopatra and about Caesar's son<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c008'><sup>[223]</sup></a>
too. I have finished your first letter, now I come to
your second.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Quinti and Buthrotum we will leave till I
come to Rome, as you say. Thanks for supplying
my son's needs. You think I am wrong in thinking
the republic hangs on Brutus: but it is a fact.
There will be none, or he and his party will save
it. You exhort me to send a written speech.
You may take it from me, my dear Atticus, as a
general axiom with regard to those matters, in
which I have sufficient experience, that no one,
whether poet or orator, ever thought anyone better
than himself. This is so even in the case of bad
ones: and what do you think it will be in the
case of Brutus, who has talent and learning?
Besides I have had experience of him lately over
the edict. I had written one at your request. I
liked mine, he liked his. Nay more, when I was induced
by his entreaties to dedicate to him my book</p>

me but to you also, that what I found pleasing, he
did not approve. So, pray, let every man do his
writing for himself. "To each his own wife; mine
for me. To each his own love; mine for me."
It is not neatly put, for it is by Atilius, the most
wooden of poets. I only hope Brutus may be able
to deliver a speech. If he can enter the city in
safety, we have won. For, as the leader in a new
civil war, no one will follow him, or at least only
those who can easily be conquered.</p>

<p class='c000'>I come to your third letter. I am glad Brutus
and Cassius were pleased with my letter: so I
have sent an answer. They want me to turn
Hirtius into a better citizen. I am doing my best,
and his promises are fair enough, but he spends
all his days and nights with Balbus, whose promises
are fair enough too. How much of them you can
believe, you must see for yourself. I observe
you are very well satisfied with Dolabella, and I
am more than satisfied. I saw a lot of Pansa at
Pompeii: and he quite convinced me that he was
well inclined and desirous of peace. I can see quite
clearly that a pretext for war is being sought. The
edict of Brutus and Cassius I approve. You want
me to consider what I think they ought to do.
One has to form one's plans according to circumstances;
and, as you see, they are changing every
hour. I think Dolabella's first move and this speech
of his against Antony have both done a lot of
good. Things are certainly advancing: and now
we seem to be going to have a leader, which is
the very thing the country towns and the well
affected want. You mention Epicurus and dare
to say "take no part in politics." Are you not</p>

to my extraordinary surprise, without a letter from
you. But I quickly conjectured you had been at
Lanuvium. Eros however had hastened to let me
have a letter from Dolabella, not about my debt
(for he had not got my letter yet), but an answer,
and a very good answer too, to the one of which
I sent you a copy. No sooner had I got rid of
Cassius' messenger than Balbus came to see me.
Good God, how easy it is to see that he is afraid
of peace! And you know how secretive the man
is. Yet he told me Antony's plans. He is canvassing
all the veterans, asking them to support
Caesar's acts and to take an oath to that effect,
to keep in camps, which are to be inspected
every month by two officials. He grumbled too
about the prejudice against himself, and everything
he said seemed to show affection for Antony.

you want to know, I see quite clearly that they
are afraid of peace. This is the theme on which
they are always dwelling: that a most distinguished
person has been killed, that by his death the whole
state has been thrown into disorder; that his acts
will be null and void as soon as we have ceased
to fear; that his clemency was his destruction,
and that, if he had not practised clemency, such
a thing could not have happened to him. I cannot
help thinking, then, that if Pompey comes with
a strong force, which is quite possible, there will
certainly be war. When I picture this and think
of it, I am disturbed: for now we shall not have
the choice you had before. For we have shown
our joy openly. Again they speak of us as ingrates.

more than you can believe, and not, I assure you,

What do I want with a doctor now? And, if I do
want one, is there such a dearth of them? It is his love

<p class='c000'>Let us return to our heroes. You hint that you
have good hopes for them in the moderate tone of
the edicts. But, when Hirtius left me at Puteoli on
the 16th of May to meet Pansa at Naples, his whole
mind was revealed to me. For I took him aside and
exhorted him to keep the peace. He could not, of
course, say that he did not want peace, but he did
say that he was as much afraid of armed action on
our side as from Antony, and that after all both had
reason for being on their guard, and for his part he
was afraid of hostilities from both. In fact he is
quite unreliable.</p>

<p class='c000'>About young Quintus I agree with you. His father,
at any rate, was most pleased with your nice letter.
Caerellia I easily satisfied; she did not seem to me
to bother herself much, and, if she had, I certainly
should not have done so. As to the lady who you
say is plaguing you, I wonder you listened to her at
all. For, if I did compliment her before friends,
when three of her own sons and your daughter were
present, what is there in that?</p>

He has written to me too, and perhaps I shall do so.
But I really don't know what he wants. What advice
can I give him, when I want advice myself, and when
he has thought of his immortality rather than our
peace of mind? The rumour about Cleopatra is
dying out. As to Flamma, pray do what you can.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yesterday I sent off a letter to you as I was leaving
Puteoli and stopped at my house at Cumae. There
I found Pilia enjoying the best of health. Indeed,
I saw her again shortly afterwards at Cumae. For
she had come for a funeral, which I also was attending.
Our friend Cn. Lucullus was burying his mother.
So I stayed that day at Sinuessa, and there I have
scribbled this as I am starting early in the morning
of the next day for Arpinum. However, I have no
news either to write to you or to ask from you, unless
you think this is to the point. Brutus has sent
me the speech he delivered in the meeting on the
Capitol, and has asked me to correct it without regarding
his feelings, before he publishes it. Now the
speech is most elegantly expressed as regards its
sentiments, and its language could not be surpassed.
But myself, if I had pleaded that cause, I should
have written with more fire. You realize what the
theme is and what the speaker is. So I could not
alter it. For considering the style our friend Brutus
affects and the opinion he holds of the best style of
oratory, he has attained it in its highest elegance in
this speech. But rightly or wrongly I have aimed
at something different. However, I should like you
to read the speech, if you have not done so already,
and to let me know your opinion, though I am afraid
that your name will lead you astray and you will be
hyper-Attic in your criticism. However, if you will

But to me his whole policy seems to point to war,
since D. Brutus is being robbed of his province.
Whatever I may think of Brutus' resources, I don't
think that can happen without war. But I don't
want war, since the Buthrotians are all right as it is.
You may smile: but I am sorry it was not rather accomplished
by my persistence, diligence, and influence.
You say you don't know what our friends are
to do: that difficulty has been bothering me for a

he ought to pursue. Alas! I have not the remotest

the province to be assigned by the Senate to Brutus

is here at Tusculum—and he strongly advises me to
keep away. He does so on the strength of the danger
which he says there has been even for him; but,
even if there be no danger, I am so far from caring
to avoid giving Antony a suspicion that I do not
rejoice in his prosperity, that the very reason why I
would rather not go to Rome is to avoid seeing him.
But our friend Varro has sent me a letter from somebody
or other—I don't know who, as he has erased
the name—telling him that the veterans whose claims
have been put off (for some of them have been disbanded)

I have written to Antony about the legation, for fear
that, if I had written only to Dolabella, his quick
temper might be aroused. But, as it is said to be
rather difficult to get an audience with him, I have
written to Eutrapelus, so that he may deliver my

<p class='c000'>On the evening of the 2nd I received a letter from
Balbus telling me there would be a meeting of the
Senate on the 5th to send Brutus to Asia, and Cassius
to Sicily, to buy corn and send it to Rome. What a
shame! First that they should take any office from
that party, and secondly, if any, that it should be this
subordinate<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c008'><sup>[249]</sup></a> position. Still, I don't know whether
it is not better than for him to sit on the banks of
his Eurotas.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c008'><sup>[250]</sup></a> But fate must have its way in this.
He says that at the same time a decree will be passed
assigning provinces to them and other ex-praetors.
This is certainly better than his Persian porch. For
I don't want you to think I am referring to a Sparta
farther off than Lanuvium. "You can jest," you
will say, "in such important matters?" What am I
to do? I am tired of mourning.</p>

me transfixed with horror! How did that violent
brawl happen in your house? But I am glad this
cloud passed away quickly. I am very eager to know
how you have fared with your sad and very difficult
conciliatory mission; for the knot cannot be unravelled.
We are so surrounded by force of every
kind. Brutus' letter, which you show that you have
read, has so disturbed me, that, undecided as I was
before, my sorrow makes me still slower at making
up my mind. But I will write more when I have

<p class='c000'>What an affectionate letter from Brutus! And
what hard luck that you cannot go to him! But
what am I to say? That they should accept the
other party's favours? That were the depth of
shame. That they should try some new move? They
dare not, and now they cannot. Well, suppose I
advise them to keep quiet and they do, who can
guarantee their safety? Indeed, if anything unpleasant
happens to Decimus, what sort of life shall
we lead, even if no one molests us? It is a sad disgrace
not to preside at the games.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c008'><sup>[251]</sup></a> Fancy putting

this but promotion downwards,<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c008'><sup>[252]</sup></a> and what state office
is more contemptible? To give advice in such matters
is certainly quite unsafe, even for those who give it.
If I were doing good, I might overlook that; but
why should I put my foot in it to no purpose? Since
he is following his mother's advice, or rather her
supplications, why should I interfere? However, I
will consider what kind of letter I can write, for I
must give some answer. So I will write at once
either to Antium or to Circeii.</p>

<p class='c000'>I reached Antium on the 8th. Brutus was very glad
to see me. Then before Servilia, Tertulla, Porcia,<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c008'><sup>[253]</sup></a>
and a lot of others, he asked me for my opinion.
Favonius was present too. I had made up my mind
on the journey, and advised him to accept the control
of the corn supply from Asia: there was nothing
else for us to do now except to keep him out of
danger: by so doing we should have some safeguard
for the republic too. When I was in the midst of
my speech, in came Cassius. I said the same over
again. Whereupon Cassius, with flashing eyes and
fairly breathing war, declared he would not go to
Sicily. "Am I to take an insult like a favour?"
"What will you do then?" I asked; and he said he
would go to Achaia. "What of you, Brutus," I
said. "To Rome," he answered, "if you think I
ought." "I don't think so at all, for you won't be
safe." "Well, if it were possible to be there in
safety, would you approve?" "Yes, I would rather
you did not go to a province either now or after
your praetorship; but I don't advise you to trust
yourself in Rome." I gave him the reasons that
will occur to you, why it would not be safe. Then
they kept on bewailing the chances that had been
let slip, especially Cassius, and they complained bitterly
of Decimus. I said they ought not to harp on
the past, but I agreed with them. When I had gone
on to explain what ought to have been done, saying
nothing new, but what everybody is saying daily,</p>

by them, your friend Servilia exclaimed: "That I
never heard anyone...." I interrupted her. But
I think Cassius will go (for Servilia promises she will
see that that appointment to the corn-supply shall
be withdrawn from the senatorial decree): and
our friend soon gave up his silly talk of wanting
to go to Rome. So he has made up his mind that
the games may be held in his absence under his
name. I fancy, however, he wants to set out for Asia
from Antium. To cut the matter short, I got nothing
that satisfied me out of that journey except the satisfaction
to my conscience. For I could not allow him
to leave Italy before I had met him. Save for fulfilling

me that he cannot be safe in Rome (for he prefers
the games to take place in his absence). He says he
will go to Asia at once, as soon as he has handed
over the management of the games to those who

and as weighty as any. So I will make an effort not

of Bassus has come announcing that the legions in

blames Vettienus—of course he is up to some dodge
like a true business man—but he says Sestius, who
is a very honest fellow and a good friend of mine,
has undertaken the whole affair. Still, I should like
to know what on earth Sestius can do in this business
that any of us could not have done. But if anything

<p class='c000'>On the 26th I received a letter from Dolabella,
and I am sending you a copy of it. In it he says
he has done everything you wanted. I answered at
once, thanking him profusely. However, to prevent
his wondering why I should do so twice, I gave as
a reason that I had not been able to get any information

me by letter of your great liberality and the
great kindness you had shown him, and when you
yourself had written that you had done all that we
wished, I sent you my thanks couched in such terms
that you might understand that you had done me
the greatest favour. But afterwards, when Atticus
came himself to me at Tusculum solely to declare
his gratitude to you, as he had observed your remarkable
and indeed wonderful kindness in the
matter of the people of Buthrotum and your strong
affection for himself, I could not help expressing my
thanks again more clearly in this letter. For of
all the favours and services you have done for me,
and they are overwhelming, my dear Dolabella, let
me assure you that the highest and the most gratifying
is, that you have shown Atticus how great my
affection is for you, and yours for me. For the rest,
as one generally wishes to secure favours received,
though the case of Buthrotum and its existence as
a city have been set on a firm footing by you, I</p>

politely what he wanted, he said he wanted Atticus.
But the insolence of the queen herself, when she
was in her villa across the river, I cannot mention

them. They don't credit me with any spirit or even
any feelings at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>My departure from Italy I see is hindered by Eros'
management of my affairs. For, although from the
balances he made on April 5 I ought to have plenty
of cash, I have to borrow, and I think the receipts
from those paying concerns are set aside for the
shrine. But I have given Tiro orders about this, and
am sending him to Rome on purpose. I did not want
to add to your worries. The more moderate in his
demands my son is, the more am I concerned about
him. For he has not mentioned this point to me,
the person of all others to whom of course he
ought to have mentioned it; but in a letter to
Tiro he said I had sent him nothing since April 1,
which was the end of his financial year. Now I
know that you, with your usual amiability, have
always agreed and indeed thought that among
other things my dignity demanded that he should
be treated not only liberally, but even with excessive
and extravagant liberality. So I should like you to
see that he has a bill of exchange for his annual
allowance payable at Athens. I would not trouble
you, if I could manage it through anyone else. Eros,
of course, will pay you. That is why I have sent
Tiro. Please see about it and let me know if you
have any views on the point.</p>

For I have not a word from Siregius. I don't like it.
About your neighbour Plaetorius I was very annoyed
that anyone heard before I did. About Syrus you
did well. I fancy you will easily frighten L. Antonius
through his brother Marcus. I told you not
to pay Antro, but you had not yet received my letter
forbidding you to pay anyone except L. Fadius the
aedile. It is the only safe and proper thing. You
say you are £1,000 out of pocket on the money
sent to my son; please ask Eros what has become
of the rents of the blocks of houses. I am not at

of starting on my journey until my accounts<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c008'><sup>[270]</sup></a> are

<p class='c000'>Now hear what I have to say to the second. You
are acting as kindly as usual in standing by Servilia,
that is to say, Brutus. As to Cleopatra, I am glad
you are not anxious and that you accept the evidence.
The state of Eros' accounts I have heard from Tiro,
and I have sent for Eros himself. I am most grateful
for your promise not to let my son lack in anything.
Messalla, on his way back from our adversaries at
Lanuvium, called on me with wonderfully good news
about him, and upon my word his own letter is so
affectionate and well-written that I should not be
ashamed to read it before an audience. So I feel all
the more indulgently disposed towards him. I don't
think Sestius is annoyed about Bucilianus. As soon

he is angry with Antony about something;
perhaps he is looking for some new way of distinguishing
himself; or perhaps it is all bunkum;
and no doubt that is what it is. But for all that I
am afraid, and his father is disturbed about him, for
he knows what he used to say about Antony; indeed,
he said things to me which I cannot repeat.

<p class='c000'>I have thanked Vettienus; for nothing could have
been kinder. Let Dolabella give me what commissions
he will, provided I have something, even a
message to Nicias. For, as you say, who will deny
it? Can any sane man doubt now that I am going
away in despair, not on a mission? You say that
people, aye, even good citizens, are talking of desperate
political measures. I began to have my doubts
on the day that I heard that tyrant called "a most
distinguished man." Afterwards, when I was with
you at Lanuvium and saw that our friends had precisely
so much hope of life as Antony gave them, I
lost all hope. So, my dear Atticus, I hope you will
take what I am going to say with the same courage
as I write it. As I think the kind of death towards
which the current of affairs is setting is disgraceful
and hold that we are practically condemned to it by
Antony, I have decided to escape from the toils,
not so much to escape as in hope of a better death.
All this is Brutus' fault.</p>

<p class='c000'>You say Pompeius has been received at Carteia.
So there will soon be an army sent against him.
Then which camp am I to choose? For Antony
makes neutrality impossible. That is weak, this is
criminal. So let me hasten away. But give me your
counsel whether to sail from Brundisium or Puteoli.
Brutus does wisely to go, but it is sudden. I am
rather upset about it, for when shall I see him again?
But such is life. You yourself cannot see him.
Heaven confound that dead man for ever touching
Buthrotum. But away with the past; let us see

<p class='c000'>Young Quintus' absence is a blessing; he won't be
a nuisance to us. I believe Pansa is talking amiably.
I know he is always hand in glove with Hirtius; I
think he will be quite friendly with Brutus and
Cassius, if it is expedient—but will he ever see them?—and
that he will oppose Antony: but when and
how? How long are we to be fooled? I said Sextus
was coming, not because he was already near, but
because he certainly has it in mind, and does not
show the least sign of laying down his arms. Certainly,
if he goes on, war must come. But our good
lover of Cytheris<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c008'><sup>[280]</sup></a> thinks no one sure of his life
unless he gains a victory. What has Pansa to say
to this? And which side will he take if there is
war? So far as I can see, there will be. But more
of this and other things when we meet—to-day,
according to your letter, or to-morrow.</p>

So many ideas for and against that journey of mine

that is going to last. Until the matter is settled,

<p class='c000'>I see you have done all you could in Quintus'
business. He, however, is in distress and doubt as
to whether he shall oblige Lepta or damage his son's
credit. I have heard a rumour that L. Piso wants to
go on a mission with a forged decree of the senate.
I should like to know what there is in it. The messenger
I told you I had sent to Brutus came to me at
Anagnia on the night of the 30th of June, and brought
me a letter in which there was one request quite unlike
his usual common-sense, the same old request
that I should be present at his games. I answered, of
course, firstly that I had already set out now, so that
it was not in my power to do so, and secondly that
it would be most out of place for me, who have not
been near Rome at all since the outbreak of war—not
so much to preserve my safety as to preserve my
dignity—suddenly to go to the games. For at such
a time it was honourable for him to give the games,
since he had to do so, but, as there was no necessity
for me to attend them, it would not be honourable
for me to do so. Of course I keenly desire that they
should be well attended and very popular, and I
trust they will be; and I beg you to send me a
description of how these games and all the other
games are received day by day from the very beginning.
But enough of the games. The rest of the
letter is, one must confess, of rather a dubious kind,
but still he does at times emit some sparks of manly
courage. That you may judge for yourself what it
is like, I have sent you a copy of the letter, although</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>my messenger tells me he brought you a letter, too,
from Brutus, and that it was forwarded to you from
Tusculum.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have arranged my journeys so that I shall be at
Puteoli on the 7th of July; for, though I am in a
great hurry, I mean to take every care humanly
possible in my voyage. Please relieve M. Aelius of
his anxiety. Tell him I thought that on a few feet at
the far end of the land there might be some sort of
claims, and those only underground. Also that I have
not the slightest desire for it, and that I don't value
water at that price.<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c008'><sup>[292]</sup></a> But, as you suggested, do it
as mildly as possible, rather to relieve him of anxiety
than to suggest that I am in the least annoyed.
Again, about that debt of Tullius: speak to Cascellius
frankly. It is a small matter, but I am glad you
attended to it. There was too much trickery about
it: and, if he had cheated me at all, which he very
nearly did if you had not been too sharp for him, I
should have been very much annoyed. So, whatever
happens, I would rather the matter were broken off.
Remember that an eighth share of the houses of
Tullius near the temple of Strenia is due to Caerellia,
and see that it is conveyed to her at the
highest price bid at the auction. I think that was
some 3,000 guineas.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c008'><sup>[293]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f292'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r292'>292</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The reading and meaning of this passage is uncertain.
Apparently either Cicero had asserted some claim on some
underground water-pipes on property of Aelius adjoining his
own, and was now disclaiming it; or Aelius had been commissioned
to buy property for Cicero on which there was a
disputed claim to such pipes, and Cicero refuses to purchase
on that ground. <em>Servitus</em> above is used in the technical-legal
sense of an "easement" or liability on property.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am glad you recommend me to do what I did of my
own accord yesterday. For to the same messenger,
to whom I gave the letter I sent you on the 2nd, I
also gave another for Sestius, written in very friendly
terms. It is very good of him to follow me to Puteoli,
but he has no grounds for his complaint. For it was
not my business to wait for his return from Cosa, so
much as it was his not to go until he had seen me,
or to return more quickly. He knew I wanted to
start in a hurry, and he told me he would come to
me at Tusculum. I am grieved that you wept when
you left me. If you had done so in my presence, I
might have changed all my plans about going. But
there is one good thing, that you were consoled by
the thought of meeting me again soon; and that,
indeed, is the hope that buoys me up. I will not
stint you of letters, and will give you full news
about Brutus. I will send you my book <cite>On Glory</cite>
soon. I will hammer out something in the style of
Heracleides to be stored up in your treasure-house.
I remember about Plancus. Attica has good reason
for grumbling. I am much obliged to you for telling

<p class='c000'>As I told you in my letter yesterday, I have arranged
to be at Puteoli on the 7th. So I shall look
for a daily letter from you there, especially about the
games. You ought to write to Brutus too about
them. I sent you a copy yesterday of a letter of his,
of which I can hardly make anything myself. Please
make my excuses to Attica by taking the blame on
yourself and assuring her that I depart with undiminished
affection for her.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am sending you Brutus' letter. Heavens, what
a helpless condition he is in! You will understand
when you have read it. I agree about the celebration
of his games. Don't go to Aelius' house on any
account, but speak to him if you happen to meet
him. Take M. Axianus' advice about the half of
Tullius' debt, as you suggest. What you have done
with Cosianus is excellent. Thanks for clearing up
my affairs and your own at the same time. I am
glad you approve of my appointment. God grant
your promises come true. For what could suit me
and mine better? But I am afraid of the proviso</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>you make about Attica's ill-health. When I meet
Brutus I will tell you all about him. I hope you are
right about Plancus and Decimus. I am sorry if
Sextus is throwing down his shield. Give me news
of Mundus if you have any. I have answered all
your points: now for my own news.</p>

<p class='c000'>Young Quintus is coming with me as far as Puteoli—what
a noble citizen! you might call him a Favonius
Asinius.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c008'><sup>[295]</sup></a> He has two reasons: he wants to
be with me and to make peace with Brutus and
Cassius. But what have you to say to this? For
I know you are intimate with the Othones. He
says that Julia proposed it herself, for a divorce has
been arranged. His father has asked me what sort
of reputation she has. Not knowing why he asked,
I said I had never heard anything about her except
about her looks and her father. "But why?" I
asked: and he said his son wanted her. Then, though
I was disgusted, I said I did not believe in those
reports. My brother's point is not to offer him any
allowance, but she says it is no business of his. I
suspect, however, he is indulging in fairy tales as
usual. Still I should like you to make enquiries,
which will be no trouble to you, and let me know.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r295'>295</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Favonius was a follower of Cato; Asinius Pollio a
Caesarian. Possibly Cicero may mean that Quintus sided
with both parties; but the exact meaning is doubtful.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>What, pray, is this? When I had already sealed
this letter, some Formians, who were dining with
me, said they had seen Plancus<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c008'><sup>[296]</sup></a>—the one from Buthrotus—the

been ejected by the Buthrotians. Well done they!

<p class='c000'>On the 7th of Quinctilis I arrived at Puteoli, and I
am writing this on the following day as I am crossing
to Brutus at Nesis. The day I arrived Eros brought
me your letter as I was dining. Is it really so? The

go on cursing all day. Could they have insulted
Brutus worse than with their <em>July</em>? So I must fall
back on my old cry, "How long, O Lord?" I have
never seen anything like that. But what, pray,
is this I hear about the land-grabbers being cut
to pieces at Buthrotum? And why has Plancus
been on the run, as they tell me he has, day and
night? I am very eager to know what it means.
I am glad my departure is approved; I must see
whether my staying may be approved too. That the
people of Dyme, now they have been expelled from
their land, should take to piracy is no wonder. There
may be some safeguard in having Brutus as a fellow-passenger,
but I think his vessels are small. I shall
know soon and will tell you to-morrow. I think the
report about Ventidius is a false alarm. It is held
pretty certain that Sextus is laying down his arms;
and, if that is so, it looks as though we should be
reduced to slavery without even a civil war. What</p>

that Xeno treats him very sparingly and niggardly.
The excess over the rental of the town houses that
your bill of exchange cost, may be reckoned to the
year, in which there was the additional expense of the
journey. From the 1st of April on let him have up
to £800,<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c008'><sup>[303]</sup></a> for that is the rent of the city property
now. Some sort of provision must be made for him
when he comes to Rome. For I don't think he could
endure that woman as a mother-in-law. I refused Pindarus'
offer for the villa at Cumae. Now let me tell
you why I have sent a messenger. Young Quintus
is promising to be as prim as a puritan: and both
he and his father have begged me to go bail to you
for him, but on the condition that you only believe
it when you see it. I shall give him a letter according
to his fancy, but don't take any notice of it. I
am writing now to prevent you from thinking that
I do. God grant he keeps his promise. It would
be a satisfaction to everybody. But I—I won't say
any more. He is leaving on the 9th. For he says
there is some money to be paid over on the 15th,
but that he is very hard pressed. You will judge
from my letter how to answer. More when I have
seen Brutus and am sending Eros back. I accept
dear Attica's apology and send her my best love.
Give my regards to her and Pilia.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 10th I received two letters, one by my
own messenger, another from Brutus'. Here the
story about the Buthrotians was very different; but
that, like many other things, we must put up with.
I have sent Eros back sooner than I intended, that
there may be someone to pay Hortensius and Ovia,
with whom, indeed, he says he had made an appointment
for the 15th. It is really shameless of
Hortensius, for there is nothing owing to him except
on the third instalment, which is due on the 1st of
August; and the greater part of that instalment has
been paid some time before the proper date. But
Eros will see to that on the 15th.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Publilius' case I don't think there ought to be
any delay in letting him have a draft for what is
owing. But, when you see how much I have yielded
my rights in paying up half of a balance of £4,000<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c008'><sup>[305]</sup></a>
in ready money, and now giving a bill for the rest,
you may, if you think fit, tell him that he ought to
await my convenience, when I have waived so much
of my rights. But please, my dear Atticus—see how
coaxingly I put it—do transact, regulate, and manage
all my affairs while you are in Rome, without waiting
for a hint from me. For though I have sufficient
outstanding debts to meet my creditors, it often
happens that the debtors don't pay at the proper
time. If anything of that sort happens, consider
nothing so much as my credit. Preserve it not only
by raising a fresh loan, but by selling if necessary.</p>

the pirates, who are said to be in evidence.</p>

<div class='english-page'>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>told us that Philo, a freedman of Pompey, and Hilarus,
one of his own, had come from Sextus with a
letter for the consuls, "or whatever they call them."
He read us a copy to see what we thought of it.
There were a few odd expressions, but in other
respects it was sufficiently dignified and not aggressive.
We only thought it better to make an addition
of "Praetors, Tribunes of the People, and Senate"
to the simple address to the "Consuls," for fear they
should not publish a letter sent to them. They say
that Sextus has been at Carthage with only one
legion, and that he received the news about Caesar
on the very day that he took the town of Barea.
After the capture there were great rejoicings and a
change of sentiment, and people flocked to him from
every side, but he returned to the six legions he
had left in lower Spain. He has written to Libo
himself saying it is all nothing to him if he cannot
get home. The upshot of his demands is, that all
the armies everywhere should be disbanded. That
is all about Sextus.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have been making enquiries in every direction
about the Buthrotians, and discover nothing. Some
say the land-grabbers were cut to pieces, others that
Plancus pocketed the money and fled, leaving them
in the lurch. So I don't see how I can find out what
there is in it, unless I get a letter at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>The route to Brundisium, about which I was hesitating,
seems to be out of the question. They say
the troops are arriving there. But the voyage from
here has some suspicion of danger, so I have made
up my mind to sail in company with Brutus. I found
him better prepared than I had heard he was. For
both he and Domitius have quite good two-banked
galleys, and there are also some good ships belonging</p>

on Cassius' fleet, which is quite a fine one, beyond
the straits of Sicily. There is one point that annoys
me a little, Brutus seems in no hurry. First he is
waiting for news of the completion of his games;
then, so far as I can understand, he is going to sail
slowly, stopping at several places. Still I think it
will be better to sail slowly than not to sail at all;
and if, when we have got some distance, things seem
clearer, we shall take advantage of the Etesian

Duxi enim mecum adulescentem ad Brutum. Sic ei

that he will come up to your and our expectations
for the future; and he did not ask you to believe
this at once, but that you should restore your affection
to him, when you had seen it for yourself. If he
had not convinced me of it, and I did not think that
what I am saying is trustworthy, I should not have
done what I am going to tell you. I took the young
man with me to Brutus, and he was so convinced of
what I mention that he believed it on his own account,
refusing to hold me sponsor for Quintus. He praised
him and mentioned you in the most friendly way,
and dismissed him with an embrace and a kiss. So,
although there is more reason for congratulating you
than asking favours of you, still I do ask you, if you
have regarded his actions up to now as showing some
of the flightiness of youth, to believe that he has
got rid of that, and to trust me that your influence
will contribute much, or rather everything, towards
making his decision permanent.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have frequently thrown out a hint to Brutus
about sailing with him, but he does not seem to
jump at it as I thought he would. He seemed to
me rather distrait, and indeed he was, especially
about the games. But when I got back home, Lucceius,
who is very intimate with him, said he was
hesitating a good deal, not because he has changed
his mind, but in the hope that something may turn
up. So I am wondering whether to make for Venusia
and there await news of the troops. If they are
not there, as some think, I shall go to Hydrus; if
neither road is safe, I will come back here. Do you
think I am joking? Upon my life you are the only
person who keeps me here. Just look round you,

While I was waiting there for the wind—our friend
Valerius has a house there, so I was at home and
enjoying myself—there came some men of mark of
Regium, fresh from Rome, among them a guest of
our friend Brutus, who said he had left Brutus at
Naples. They brought an edict of Brutus and Cassius

They said there were great hopes that Antony
might yield, some agreement be arrived at, and
our friends allowed to return to Rome; and they
added that I was missed and people were inclined
to blame me.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I heard that, I had no hesitation about
giving up my idea of going away, which to be
sure I had never fancied even before that: and
when I read your letter, I was certainly surprised
that you had so utterly changed your opinion;
but there seemed to me to be good reason for it.
However, though it was not you who persuaded
and urged me to go, you certainly approved of
my going, if I got back by the end of the year.
That would have meant, that, when there was
little danger, I should have been away, and should
return when it was in full blaze. But that, although
it was not a counsel of prudence, I have no right
to resent, first because it happened by my own
wish, and secondly, even if you had advised me,
an adviser need not guarantee anything but his
sincerity. What did astonish me beyond measure
was that you should use the words: "A fine thing
for you, who talk of a noble death, a fine thing,
i' faith. Go, desert your country." Was I deserting
it, or did you at the time think I was deserting it?
You not only raised no finger against it, you even
approved of it. The rest is even more severe:
"I wish you would write me an explanatory note
showing that it was your duty to do it?" So,
my dear Atticus? Does my action need defending,
especially to you, who expressed strong approval?
Yes, I will write a defence, but for some of those
who opposed my going and spoke against it.</p>

consilii inconstantiam dixit esse. Deinceps igitur
haec: "Nam, si a Phaedro nostro esses, expedita

flagitii scilicet plenum et dedecoris. Utinam a primo

Cato. Extremum illud vel molestissimum: "Nam
Brutus noster silet," hoc est: non audet hominem id
aetatis monere. Aliud nihil habeo, quod ex iis a te
verbis significari putem, et hercule ita est. Nam,

erat enim cum suis navibus apud Heletem fluvium

Dei immortales, quam valde ille reditu vel potius
reversione mea laetatus effudit illa omnia, quae tacuerat!
ut recordarer illud tuum "Nam Brutus noster
silet." Maxime autem dolebat me Kal. Sext. in
senatu non fuisse. Pisonem ferebat in caelum; se
autem laetari, quod effugissem duas maximas vituperationes,
unam, quam itinere faciendo me intellegebam
suscipere, desperationis ac relictionis rei publicae
(flentes mecum vulgo querebantur, quibus de meo
celeri reditu non probabam), alteram, de qua Brutus,
et qui una erant (multi autem erant), laetabantur,</p>

<div class='english-page'>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Though what need is there of an explanatory
note? If I had gone on, there would have been.
"But coming back is not consistent." No philosopher
ever called a change of plan inconsistency, though
there has been a good deal written on the point.
So you add: "If you were a follower of our friend
Phaedrus,<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c008'><sup>[316]</sup></a> one would have a defence ready: but,
as it is, what answer can one give?" So my deed
was one Cato would not approve of, was it? Of
course then it was criminal and disgraceful. Would
to heaven you had thought so at first; you should
have been my Cato, as you usually are. Your
last cut is the most unkind of all: "For our
friend Brutus holds his peace," that is to say, he
does not dare remonstrate with a man of my age.
I see no other meaning that I can attach to your
words, and no doubt that is it. For on the 17th,
when I reached Velia, Brutus heard of it—he was
with his boats on the river Heles about three miles
from Velia; and he came at once on foot to see
me. Great heavens, how he let out all his pent-up
silence in joy at my return or rather my turning
back. I could not help thinking of your "Our
friend Brutus holds his peace." But what he
regretted most was that I was not in the House
on the first of August. Piso he lauded to the
skies: and he expressed his delight that I had
escaped two grounds for reproach. One of these
was that of despairing and abandoning the country—and
that I knew I might incur in undertaking the
voyage; for many had complained to me with tears
in their eyes, and I could not convince them of
my speedy return. The other point that rejoiced
Brutus and those who were with him—and there</p>

reproach of being thought to be going to the
Olympian games. Nothing could be more disgraceful
than that in any political circumstances,
but at the present time it would be inexcusable.
I of course felt very grateful to the south wind,
which had saved me from such infamy.</p>

<p class='c000'>There you have the ostensible reasons for my
return; and they are good and sufficient reasons
too; but none of them is better than one you
mention in your letter: "If you owe anything to
anyone, take measures to provide yourself with
the means to pay each his due. For the money
market is wonderfully tight owing to fear of war."
I was in the middle of the straits when I read
this letter, and I could not think of any way of
taking measures, unless I came to look after it
myself. But enough of this; more when we meet.</p>

<p class='c000'>I got a sight of Antony's edict from Brutus, and
of our friends' magnificent answer; but I don't quite
see the use or the object of these edicts. Nor
have I come as Brutus thought, to take part in
the management of affairs. For what can be done?
Did anybody agree with Piso? Did he himself
come back the next day? But, as the saying goes,
a man of my time of life ought not to go far from
his grave.</p>

<p class='c000'>But for mercy's sake what is this that I hear
from Brutus! He says you told him Pilia had
had an attack of paralysis. I am very much disturbed
about it, though he tells me you say you
hope she is better. I sincerely hope she is; give
her and darling Attica my best regards. This I have
written on ship-board, as I was getting near to
Pompeii, Aug. 19.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I know what day I shall arrive, I will
let you know. I must wait for my heavy baggage,
which is coming from Anagnia, and there is illness
in my household. On the evening of the 1st I
got a letter from Octavian. He is setting about
a heavy task. He has brought over the veterans,
who are at Casilinum and Calatia, to his views;
and no wonder, when he is giving them £20<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c008'><sup>[317]</sup></a>
apiece. He thinks of visiting the other colonies.
Obviously his idea is a war with Antony under his
leadership. So I see that before long we shall
be in arms. But whom are we to follow? Look
at his name, and at his age. And his first request
of me is that I should meet him secretly at Capua
or somewhere near Capua. That is quite childish,
if he thinks it can be done secretly. I have told
him by letter that there is no necessity for it and
no possibility of it. He sent me one Caecina of
Volaterra, an intimate friend of his, who brought
this news, that Antony is making for Rome with
the legion Alauda, raising a forced contribution
from towns, and marching with his soldiers under
colours. He asked my advice about setting out
for Rome with 3,000 veterans or holding Capua
and intercepting Antony's advance, or going to
the three Macedonian legions, which are making
for the northern Adriatic. Those he hopes are on
his side; they refused to take Antony's bounty,
or so he says, heaped insults on him and left
him still haranguing. Of course, he offers himself
as our leader, and thinks we ought not to fail</p>

where are you? What a golden opportunity you
are missing! I never foresaw this, but I thought
something of the kind would happen. Now, I
want your advice. Shall I come to Rome, or stay

<p class='c000'>Two letters on one day from Octavian, now asking
me to come to Rome at once, as he wishes to act

In short he is pressing, while I am temporizing. I
do not trust his age: I do not know his disposition.
I do not want to do anything without your friend
Pansa's advice. I am afraid Antony may succeed,
and I don't like going away from the sea, and I fear
some great deed may be done in my absence. Varro,
for his part, dislikes the boy's plan; I do not. If
he can trust his army, he can have Brutus, and he is

on that day it was generally said that Antony was

that Caesar and Pompey each had three wives; (<em>b</em>) that
Septimia had three husbands; or (<em>c</em>) that it refers to some

far as Panaetius is concerned, I have finished in
two books. He has three: but, though at the
beginning he makes a three-fold division of cases
in which duty has to be determined, one when the
question is between right or wrong, another when
it is between expediency and inexpediency, and
the third, how we are to decide when it is a conflict
between duty and expediency—for example, in
Regulus' case to return would be right, to stay expedient—he
treated of the first two brilliantly; the
third he promises to add, but never wrote it. Posidonius
took up that topic: but I have ordered his
book and written to Athenodorus Calvus to send me
an analysis of it, and that I am expecting. I wish
you would spur him on and beg him to let me have
it as soon as possible. In it duties under given circumstances
are handled. As to your query about
the title, I have no doubt that καθῆκον (duty) corresponds
with <em>officium</em>, unless you have any other
suggestion to make. But the fuller title is <cite>De

to me not inappropriate.</p>

It is a case of "ashamed to shirk, but yet afraid to
take." He, however, has been acting, and still is
acting, with great vigour. He will come to Rome
with a big army; but he is such a boy. He thinks
he can call a Senate at once. Who will come? If
anyone comes, who will offend Antony in this uncertainty?
Perhaps he may act as a safeguard on
the 1st of January, or the battle may be over before
then. The country towns are wonderfully enthusiastic
for the boy. For, as he was making his way to
Samnium, he came to Cales and stopped at Teanum.

you, than be in suspense both about you and about
myself, when I am away from you. But what am
I to say to you? Keep up your heart. About
Varro's work in Heracleides' vein, that's an amusing
business. I was never so pleased with anything.
But of this and more important things when we

<p class='c000'>What a strange coincidence! On the 9th I got
up before daybreak to go on from Sinuessa, and
before dawn I had reached the Tirenian bridge
at Menturnae, where the road for Arpinum branches
off, when I met a messenger, who found me "on a
far journey bent." I at once enquired: "Pray, is
there anything from Atticus?" I could not read
as yet, for I had dismissed the link-bearers and it
was not yet light enough. But, when it got light,
I began to read the first of your two letters, having
already written one to you. Your note was a model
of elegance. Upon my life I am not saying more
than I mean. I never read a kinder. So I will
come, when you call me, provided you will assist
me. But at first sight I thought nothing could
be more <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal à propos</span></i> than such an answer to a
letter in which I had asked for your advice. Then
there is your other letter, in which you advise
me to go "by windy Mimas towards the Psyrian
isle,"<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c008'><sup>[330]</sup></a> that is keeping the Appian way on the
left side. So I have stayed the day at Aquinum.
It was rather a wearisome journey and the road
was bad. This letter I am sending the next
morning as I am leaving.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have nothing whatever to write about. For,
when I was at Puteoli, there was something fresh
about Octavian every day, and plenty of false
reports about Antony. However, I had three
letters from you on the fifth, and I strongly agree
with what you said, that if Octavian has much
success, the tyrant's proposals will receive stronger
confirmation than they did in the temple of Tellus,<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c008'><sup>[332]</sup></a>
and that will be against the interests of Brutus.
But if, on the other hand, he is conquered, you
see Antony will be intolerable; so you don't know
which you want. What a rascal Sestius' messenger
is! He said he would be in Rome the day after
he left Puteoli! You advise me to move slowly,
and I agree, though once I thought differently.
I am not influenced by Philippus or Marcellus;
for their position is different, or, if it is not, it
looks as though it were.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c008'><sup>[333]</sup></a> But that youth, though
he has plenty of spirit, has little influence. However,
see whether it would not be better for me
to be at Tusculum, if I should do right in being
there. I would rather be there; for I should get
all the news. Or had I better be here when
Antony comes?</p>

On the main point, however, I want really active

bad form to call upon the sureties for payment, still
consider how that method would do. We can bring

from you and one from Sextus. Nothing could have
been pleasanter or more amiable than Sextus' letter.
For yours was a short note, the earlier one having
been very full. It is wise and friendly advice you
give me to stay here by preference, till we hear how
this disturbance is going to end. But just at this
minute, my dear Atticus, it is not the Republic that
I am bothered about—not that any thing is or ought
to be dearer to me, but even Hippocrates admits it
is useless to apply medicine in desperate cases. So
let that go hang—it is my private concerns that
bother me. Concerns, do I say? Nay, rather my
credit; for, though I have such big balances, I have
not even enough money on hand yet to pay Terentia.
Do I speak of Terentia? You know we arranged
long ago to pay Montanus' debt of £250.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c008'><sup>[344]</sup></a> My son

and composed a petition. That he gave to me to
hand to Caesar, for I was going to dine with him
that day. That petition I handed to Caesar. He
approved of the case and wrote back to Atticus
that his request was reasonable, but he warned him
that the Buthrotians must pay the rest of the money
at the proper time. Atticus, who wanted to save
the city, paid the money on his own account. When
that was done we approached Caesar, said a word for
the Buthrotians, and obtained a most generous decree,
which was signed by persons of importance. After
that I was much astonished that Caesar used to let
those who had coveted the land of the Buthrotians
hold meetings, and not only allowed them to do so,
but even put you at the head of the commission.

were in Rome—for, as you know, he aimed at popularity—but
when they were across the sea, he would
see to it that they were transferred to some other
land. That was what happened in Caesar's lifetime.
But, after Caesar's death, as soon as the consuls in
accordance with a decree of the Senate began to investigate
cases, the facts as I have stated them were
put before them. They approved of the case without
any hesitation, and said they would send you letters.
Now, my dear Plancus, though I have no doubt that
a decree of the Senate, a statute, a decree of the
consuls, and their despatch, will have the greatest
weight with you, and I understand that you will
wish to please Atticus himself, yet I have taken it
upon myself in view of our connection and affection,
to ask you for what your own exceptional amiability
and your goodness of heart would win from you
themselves. That is, that you should for my sake
do this thing, which I am sure you will do of
your own accord, freely, fully, and quickly. I have
no greater and no dearer friend than Atticus. At
first it was only a question of his money, and a good
sum of it too; but now it concerns his credit too,
that he should obtain with your assistance what he
won by his great persistency and his popularity both
in Caesar's lifetime and after his death. If he obtains
it from you, I hope you will consider that I
shall interpret your liberality as a great favour bestowed
upon myself. For my part, I will show
care and diligence in anything that I think you
desire or that concerns you. Take care of your

in the matter of the Buthrotians, since the
consuls, who had the authority of a statute and a
senatorial decree to investigate, determine, and decide
on Caesar's proceedings, have approved of their case;
and to relieve Atticus, whom I know you admire, and
myself, who am as much concerned as he is, from
trouble. For now that we have brought the whole
business to an end with the expenditure of much
care, much labour, and pains, it rests with you to
allow us to make an end to our anxiety as early as
possible. However, I am sure that you have wisdom
enough to see, that, if the decisions delivered by the
consuls about Caesar's proceedings are not observed,
things will be thrown into great confusion. For my
part, though one cannot approve of many of Caesar's
arrangements—as was natural in the case of a person
so busy—still I am wont to uphold them staunchly
for the sake of peace and quietness: and I am
strongly of the opinion that you should do the same,
though I am not writing as an adviser but as a suppliant.
So, my dear Plancus, I beg and beseech you—and
I do assure you I could not be more anxious
or more in earnest about anything—to take in hand,
to conduct, and to carry through all this business in
such a way, that, what we have obtained from the
consuls without any hesitation solely on the justice
and equity of our case, we may obtain from you not
only with your kind indulgence but with alacrity on

that you have a great affection for me. By a decree,
which I and many important persons signed, Caesar
set free the Buthrotians, and assured us that, when
the land-commissioners had crossed the sea, he would
send a despatch about the territory to which they
should be transferred; and then it happened that he
died suddenly. Then, as you know (for you were

I know the influence you always have over those

anybody, Plancus will have sense and wisdom enough

conferred upon them by law and by a senatorial
decree, especially as, if this kind of decision is rendered

Though that is the case, still it is to our interest

<p class='c000'>I was a great admirer of your father, and he was
exceedingly attentive and affectionate to me; and I
am sure I have never had any doubt that you have a
regard for me. Certainly I have never ceased to
have one for you. So I beg you with more than
usual earnestness to assist the city of Buthrotum,
and to make it your business that our friend Plancus
should confirm and verify the decree which the
consuls made in favour of the Buthrotians, when
they had been granted the power of settling the
question both by a statute and by a senatorial decree.
This I do most earnestly beg and entreat you, my
dear Cupiennius.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pardon me for writing again on the same subject,
when I have already written very fully to you about
the Buthrotians. I do assure you, my dear Plancus,
that I do not do so because I have little faith in your
generosity or your friendship for me. But my friend
Atticus has so great a monetary stake in the matter;
and now, what is more, his very reputation is involved
in showing that he can obtain what Caesar
approved of, and we, who were present when Caesar
made his decrees and gave his answer, witnessed and
sealed. And I appeal to you especially, because it
is a case where the whole power, I will not say of
confirming, but of confirming freely and willingly</p>

doing me a favour than which none could be greater.
Although I hope that by the time you receive this

in my former letter, still I shall not cease from
asking until I have news that you have done what
I am looking forward to with great hope. Then I
trust I shall write a different kind of letter, and pay
my thanks for your exceeding kindness. If that
comes to pass I would have you think that you
have not so much put Atticus, in spite of the

render us much assistance with Plancus. I know
the kindness of your heart; I know how welcome
you are to your friends. There is no one who can

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
